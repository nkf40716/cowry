Thanks Ben,

Digging further into code, i could find out that if bridge type is given as netdev, it creates br0 (say bridge name) and ovs-net (backer if) as TAP interfaces. And rest of nics (eth0 etc) will be opening PF_PACKET socket for receiving the packet.
I could see code for internal devices that you mentioned in last reply and that explains initial questions set. (Thanks for prompt reply).

I have one more query where need help, why ovs-net and br0, 2 TAP interfaces are created and where are they used for? I am looking right now for netdev type of bridge. My initial understanding was, any local PUNT of packet (e.g. L4 packet need to be sent to local applications) will go through local interface of bridge which is TAP interface. And by virtue of that, it will follow kernel stack for further processing. But i could not understand ovs-net role? Can you please brief on this?

For netdev type of bridge, i guess netlink is not used, because i don’t see any kernel configuration needed for this case. Is my understanding correct?

Thanks..
Wanted to keep name as OVS user, looks like user is missing :)

One of our nodes starts to trace aperiodically. We're gathing logs via remote syslog, here trace (it is a bit unordered because of UDP in syslog).

Configuration:
openvswitch-switch                  2.3.1
Linux: 3.13.0-52-generic

We using: neutron with vlans, sFlow (inside OVS) on 'external' bridge.

Oh, that was my bug. I thought github is a proper place for reports.

I've done enclosing problem:

It happens when we adding sflow entry on Bridge br-int in openstack 
installation (on VLANs). We have two patch ports outside (to br-ex1 and 
br-ex2), and bunch of tap interfaces plugged to br-int with tags (by 
neutron-plugin-openvswitch-agent). Bug happens every time within 1-2 
minutes after configuration.

Subject: [ovs-discuss] [dpdk-ovs] dpdkvhost port not handling arp response
	from kvm guest
Message-ID: <556DD164.1020609@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

Hi,

I would like to bring up my kvm guest with dpdk vhost interface. Before 
I run qemu, I have added
dpdkvhost interface in ovs bridge, so as to attach with qemu later (wrt 
INSTALL.DPDK.md).

Once I created dpdkvhost interface, I noticed that dpdkvhost0 was in 
LINK_DOWN (I think it is
expected as the device does not exist yet).

ovs-master# ovs-vsctl add-port br0 dpdkvhost0 -- set Interface 
dpdkvhost0 type=dpdkvhost

ovs-master# ovs-ofctl show br0

      speed: 10 Mbps now, 0 Mbps max

 From ovs-vswitchd.log (with debug info):

2015-06-02T14:49:38.149Z|00464|bridge|INFO|bridge br0: added interface 
dpdkvhost0 on port 2

2015-06-02T14:49:38.149Z|00467|netlink_socket|DBG|received NAK error=0 
(No such file or directory)

Then I brought up qemu kvm, but still the state of dpdkvhost0 remains 
same. Networking params I used in qemu are:

      -netdev 
tap,id=hostnet2,script=no,downscript=no,ifname=dpdkvhost0,vhost=on
      -device 
virtio-net-pci,netdev=hostnet2,csum=off,gso=off,guest_tso4=off,guest_tso6=off,guest_ecn=off,id=net2,mac=52:54:00:a3:a3:5d,ioeventfd=on 

      -object 
memory-backend-file,id=mem,size=4096M,mem-path=/dev/hugepages,share=on 
-numa node,memdev=mem -mem-prealloc

Am I missing something here ?

dpdk0 port is Intel 82599 10Gbps NIC bound on igb_uio driver. VM could 
recieve arp req from remote system (on dpdk0 port), but VM's arp 
response does not seem to cross ovs.
I did not see any arp response reportedly logged by vswitchd even with 
debug info turned on, or may be that ovs is dropping them internally ?.
Or, Should dpdkvhost0 be internal port (tap) here for ovs to handle arp 
response from VM ?

from ovs-ofctl dump-flows:
NXST_FLOW reply (xid=0x4):
  cookie=0x0, duration=47.090s, table=0, n_packets=59, n_bytes=3741, 
idle_age=1, in_port=1 actions=output:2
  cookie=0x0, duration=42.129s, table=0, n_packets=0, n_bytes=0, 
idle_age=42, in_port=2 actions=output:1

This is blocking the connection to get established with VM (from remote 
system talking through dpdk0).

My env info:
Ubuntu 14.10
ovs-vsctl (Open vSwitch) 2.3.90
Compiled May 19 2015 04:27:58
DB Schema 7.12.1
dpdk-2.0.0

Any help/pointer to further diagnose is greatly appreciated.

Message-ID: <CAN2Qyza0BZwr=PFAXtE7+3THUKpG4Vk_SB+bzPkSnqn7rR10fQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, Dear all:

    I send some group table to ovs, like l3 unicast, l2 interface, l3
unicast table goto l2 interface table. But it
return OFPGMFC_CHAINING_UNSUPPORTED when i send the group to ovs.

    Doesn't ovs support group chaining which is defined in openflow1.3.

    Greate appreciate for anyone's reply.

Best Regards,
Vinllen

Group chaining is optional in OF1.3. As far as I know OVS does not support
it, which is why I use CPqD switch for chaining.

Thanks

OVS doesn't support group chaining, but we didn't know that anyone
cared, so it's interesting to hear from two (potential) users.

Ben, I believe  the reference is to this:

https://github.com/Broadcom-Switch/of-dpa/tree/master/OF-DPA-2.0

During controller/app development, it is easier to work with a software
switch, that emulates a hardware switch pipeline.
To emulate OFDPA, group chaining support is necessary.

It was also needed for some earlier related work, which pushed multiple
MPLS labels in ECMP groups.
https://wiki.onosproject.org/display/ONOS/Installation+Guide#InstallationGuide-CPqDSoftwareSwitch

Group chaining would be really nice to have

Thanks
Saurav

Aha, thankyou Saurav and Ben. I also use the of-dpa just as Saurav said.

As i kown, Broadcom switch product named of-dpa support all of the
openflow1.3 including the group chaining. When i testing the experiments in
ovs, i found their is some difference between the ovs and of-dpa.

I think it maybe necessary to support the group chaining in the ovs because
the softeware switch should get close to the hardware switch

Subject: [ovs-discuss] "Too many open files" leads to "Segmentation fault"
Message-ID: <556F0763.1090407@gmail.com>

Hello there,

I'm working on a minor fork of ovs 2.1.2 in a raspberry pi running a
raspbian. There's a controller out there, as well as other openflow
agents, also rpi. All together configure an SDN which I can manage from
the controller. However, this scenario lasts only about 20 minutes, as
ovs instances break in a terrible segfault.

Reading the log from ovs-vswitchd, I see that there's a problem with the
maximum number of open files in the system, causing it to reject
connections to Unix socket "ovs-vswitchd.<pid>.ctl"

After the initial operations, the log stays 20 minutes in silence and then:

The only traffic that is holding is composed by custom openflow
statistics messages bound to the controller. The custom messages are
about twice long as original ones, and are sent about each 10 seconds.
That is, there is little traffic going on.

It is relevant to say that the rpi's are dedicated to this function,
therefore there cannot be any other processes triggering this error.

Well then, do you think that it's normal to reach the limit of open
files under these conditions?
Is there any way to limit this so it doesn't crash?
And who is openning this file, here?

Thank you very much
Ferran

Subject: [ovs-discuss] switch as a sniffer
Message-ID: <DUB113-W94E85A67AD44A6556DED30D4B40@phx.gbl>

Hello

Dear all

I have the following question:

I want the openvswitch reads the exchanged packets and deal with them as they are sent to it.

To do so, I did the following:

I
 installed a flow-entry in the switch that matches the packet address, 
then rewrite it to the local bridge address of the switch. 

To test this:
1. I connected two hosts with a switch in between
2. the first host ping the second host, however
3.
 the controller inserts two flow entries one in the switch to catch the 
packet and rewrite it with the switch address and another in the host to
 rewrite the source address of incoming packet with the address of the 
second host, to let it think the respond is coming from the second host 
"intended one" not from the switch.
4. I run their interfaces in promisc mode.
5. working with IP addresses

However, it is not working with me

Is there something wrong with this procedure.

Any help will be appreciated

Best regards,

Subject: [ovs-discuss] about sizeof(struct) in c
Message-ID: <CAEmpd3nwFTDtdMuJyGdb0RK-CW15cN_=-cNDQZ6s6O1B5hPoKg@mail.gmail.com>

I am reading openflow-spec-v1.3.0, and in page 37 there are a few codes as
follow:

/* Full description for a queue. */
> struct ofp_packet_queue {
> uint32_t queue_id;
> /* id for the specific queue. */
> uint32_t port;
> /* Port this queue is attached to. */
> uint16_t len;
> /* Length in bytes of this queue desc. */
> uint8_t pad[6];
> /* 64-bit alignment. */
> struct ofp_queue_prop_header properties[0]; /* List of properties. */
> };
> OFP_ASSERT(sizeof(struct ofp_packet_queue) == 16);


 In my opinion, sizeof(struct ofp_packet_queue) = sizeof(queue_id) +
sizeof(port) + sizeof(len) + sizeof(pad[]) + sizeof(properties) = 4 + 4 + 2
+ 6 + 4 = 20

But the ASSERT is sizeof(struct ofp_packet_queue) == 16.

Is there anyone can point out my misunderstanding?

Thanks!

The "properties" element has zero elements, which has no length.

Yeah, it's just to indicate that there are a variable number of "struct ofp_queue_prop_header" elements that follow.

Subject: [ovs-discuss] issue regarding port mirroring
Message-ID: <556FD053.4030600@cse.iitb.ac.in>

Hi,

I have an Openstack setup with OVS version 2.1.3. I want implementing 
packet capture for the VM's traffic. I notice that a mirror on br-int 
only captures outgoing traffic. I read in one post that we can add a 
rule to create a port and modify the existing rules to have this out 
port as additional action. How can I implement the same.

Thanks,

Priyanka

Subject: [ovs-discuss] Behaviour change in OpenVSwitch
Message-ID: <CAKL=qh_CqYEn+PuUvzAA94J1TYB=h8tOSS6pLrQj9Vvpka+18A@mail.gmail.com>

I use OpenVSwitch and occasionally upgrade from the tip of master. My
previous upgrade was in Sep/2014, and I have just upgraded to last Friday's
tip. A number of previously running test cases (using oftest) now fail for
me, and I am investigating.

The v1.3 test basic.OutputExact creates a flow outputting to port 1, then
sends packets in ports 2, 3 and 4. The flow is then changed to output to
port 2 instead. Since everything else about the flow is the same, this
actually represents a change in the same flow (in my opinion) and therefore
the dpif flows created when packets were received should now be invalid.
However, when a packet is sent on port 3, instead of being output to port
2, it is output to port 1, causing the test to fail.

I think what's happening is that the dpif flows are not being deleted when
the flow changes. I am almost certain that this is not how the code used to
behave. I have also tweaked the test to explicitly remove the flow before
changing the output port, and this test passes.

The questions I have are: Can anyone point me to the code change that might
have introduced this behaviour? Is it a deliberate change or a by-product?
While I could happily proceed by changing our regression test, I would
rather see if this behaviour can be altered to behave the way it used to,
which seems to me to be more conformant to the specification.

Any advice gratefully accepted.

Hey,

Few questions,

1. how do you change the flow to output to port 2?  using
ovs-ofctl mod-flows?  Could you show the exact commands?

2. There was a commit (b2a4692 ofproto: Increase default datapath
max_idle time.) that increased the max_idle time of dpif flows.  That may
be related.

Thanks,
Alex Wang,

Subject: [ovs-discuss] Openvswitch network disconnect
Message-ID: <000001d09e8e$09921e60$1cb65b20$@progbau.de>

Hello,

We are using Openvswitch in our Openstack setup.

ovs-vswitchd --version
ovs-vswitchd (Open vSwitch) 2.3.0
Compiled Oct 28 2014 17:48:05
OpenFlow versions 0x1:0x1

We experience openvswitch failures from time to time. It seems to happen
random, no network traffic spikes for example.
The VM ports and the openvswitch port for the host management just stop
working.  But the openvswitch services (ovsdb-server/ ovs-vswitchd) are
still running

For debug purpose the following commands has been executed:

- "ovs-vsctl show" the interfaces are still listed
The ones below didn't show any result and just hang after the execution:
- ovs-appctl bond/show bond0
- ovs-appctl vlog/list
- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-bond0

A "service openvswitch restart" fix it, the connection from the VMs and the
host are back immediately.

Any help appreciated!

Cheers,
Chris

This seems to indicate that the ovs-vswitchd process is dead locked...
I could not find comment in branch-2.3 that relates to dead lock.  It would
be
helpful if you can gdb into the running ovs-vswitchd process and provide
the backtraces when there is a failure.

Or could I know what your setup looks like (ovs-vsctl show output)?

Thanks,
Alex Wang,

Hello Alex,

 

I will do the gdb debug when it happens again. 

 

Here the output, in this case there are 4 VMs running on the host. The physical interfaces eth2 & eth3 are in active-passive mode bonded to bond0. mgmt0 is used for the management of the host system. Anything else is created by OpenStack.

The failure happens independent from the number of VMs running on the host:

Hello,

We are using Openvswitch in our Openstack setup.

ovs-vswitchd --version
ovs-vswitchd (Open vSwitch) 2.3.0
Compiled Oct 28 2014 17:48:05
OpenFlow versions 0x1:0x1

We experience openvswitch failures from time to time. It seems to happen
random, no network traffic spikes for example.
The VM ports and the openvswitch port for the host management just stop
working.  But the openvswitch services (ovsdb-server/ ovs-vswitchd) are
still running

For debug purpose the following commands has been executed:

- "ovs-vsctl show" the interfaces are still listed
The ones below didn't show any result and just hang after the execution:
- ovs-appctl bond/show bond0
- ovs-appctl vlog/list
- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-bond0

 

 

This seems to indicate that the ovs-vswitchd process is dead locked...

I could not find comment in branch-2.3 that relates to dead lock.  It would be

A "service openvswitch restart" fix it, the connection from the VMs and the
host are back immediately.

Any help appreciated!

Thx for the info, I'll try reproduce it on my local setup using
active-backup
bond.  And use it as managment interface,

Will update if I run into the same issue~

Thanks,
Alex Wang,

Subject: [ovs-discuss] switch as a sniffer




Hello

Dear all

I have the following question:

I want the openvswitch reads the exchanged packets and deal with them as they are sent to it.

To do so, I did the following:

I
 installed a flow-entry in the switch that matches the packet address, 
then rewrite it to the local bridge address of the switch. 

To test this:
1. I connected two hosts with a switch in between
2. the first host ping the second host, however
3.
 the controller inserts two flow entries one in the switch to catch the 
packet and rewrite it with the switch address and another in the host to
 rewrite the source address of incoming packet with the address of the 
second host, to let it think the respond is coming from the second host 
"intended one" not from the switch.
4. I run their interfaces in promisc mode.
5. working with IP addresses

However, it is not working with me

Is there something wrong with this procedure.

Any help will be appreciated

Best regards, 

Eng Amer Alghadhban

Hello,


I'm installing openvswitch 2.3.1 in ubuntu 14.04. the OpenFlow version is 1.0.

I'm using in my architecture Flowvisor and Floodlight.

My problem is that I don't get any flow entry in my switch!

How can I configure the switch so that it can get flow entries in its table?


Thank you,

Did you use both 'select_src_port' and 'select_dst_port' options for your
mirror? Using both these options on a port would capture incoming as well
as outgoing traffic

Refer this link for more details

Hi, from your snip, it looks like you're using QEMU 2.0.0 which is incompatible with vhost-cuse. To work with the parameters you are using above, you need to use QEMU v2.1.0 or later. The error you are seeing is consistent with the use of an incompatible QEMU version.

Not related, our code had already increased the timeout to 6s.

My day's debugging: I am in a version of our build based on my previous
upgrade last year, and it passes the test. I'm in revalidate() and seeing
that flows are being deleted due to the return from revalidate_ukey(),
which sort of makes sense to me. The fact that udpif->need_revalidate is no
longer being set seems a bit suspicious to me. I will continue to work on
this and will update next week (since it's my Friday!).

More on my day's debugging: my previous comment was a bit premature, and a
bit confusing. To clarify:

- dpif flows are not being deleted in time when the basic.OutputExact test
runs on our most recent code
- dpif flows are being deleted in time on last year's code (based on my
previous upgrade from tip of master)
- the reason they are being deleted at all is based on the return from
revalidate_ukey(), which works in last year's code
- the latest code also appears to be making the decision to delete the flow
based on revalidate_ukey()
- so, I need to keep looking and stop talking to the list!

Turns out that the only behaviour change is a slight timing change. If I
put a 0.2s sleep into the outer loop of the test I can make is pass
reliably. In other words, the flows are still being deleted correctly, it's
just that the test is so quick in changing the flows and expecting to be
able to test the new flow that it's seeing a failure.

In the real world, there would of course be much less chance of this sort
of coordination between data and flow changes, so I am satisfied that
OpenVSwitch continues to operate in the same high quality way that I have
always experienced.

Just have to update my tests a bit (sigh).

Glad to hear you figured it out,

Curious about:
1. Do you need to do flow remove in the loop after the "for in_port..." loop
in you test?

2. Where in the outer loop do you add the sleep.?

Thanks,
Alex Wang,

Hello,

when I use: ovs-ofctl dump-flows br0, I get:NXST_FLOW reply (xid=0x4)

when I use: ovs-ofctl dump-table-features br0   I get   dump-table-features need OpenFlow 1.3 or later


Is that an issue with openvswitch and OpenFlow 1.0?

Hello,


I'm installing openvswitch 2.3.1 in ubuntu 14.04. the OpenFlow version is 1.0.

I'm using in my architecture Flowvisor and Floodlight.

My problem is that I don't get any flow entry in my switch!

How can I configure the switch so that it can get flow entries in its table?


Thank you,

Hi All, 

OVS is not able to connect to any controllers(opendaylight n floodlight). 
I am seeing following messages in ovs-vswitchd.log. 

I have checked all baisc settings of iptables, firewalld etc etc. 
On controller machine netstate -an shows the "tcp 0.0.0.0:6633" in listen mode. 

Anyone has faced this before?

Subject: [ovs-discuss] Query about active-backup mode in lacp
Message-ID: <CABZU2_T1vEPrU5jbbyrzeZHTaNuHS89DkMj+8zcU6siweGae=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
 I have question regarding how active port is selected when bond port
in configured in active-backup. port priority seem to have no effect
on active port selection.

I configured bond port as follows

"ovs-vsctl add-bond br0 bond0 poct0 poct1 bond_mod=active-backup lacp=active
other_config:lacp-time=fast"

and i can see its up

~ # ovs-appctl bond/show bond0
---- bond0 ----
bond_mode: active-backup
bond may use recirculation: no, Recirc-ID : -1
bond-hash-basis: 0
updelay: 0 ms
downdelay: 0 ms
lacp_status: negotiated

slave poct0: enabled
    may_enable: true

slave poct1: enabled
    active slave
    may_enable: true



Now the question, here poct1 is selected as the interface to forward
traffic. But how is this selection made.

i tried to configure the port priority, but port priority is not taken
into consideration.
If i change the port priority of the current active interface, active
interface gets switched. Is this expected behaviour? shouldn't
selection be always based on priority


Here is the behaviour

I change poct1 priority, active interface switches to poct0

~ # ovs-vsctl set interface poct1 other_config:lacp-port-priority=5
~ #
~ # ovs-appctl bond/show bond0
---- bond0 ----
bond_mode: active-backup
bond may use recirculation: no, Recirc-ID : -1
bond-hash-basis: 0
updelay: 0 ms
downdelay: 0 ms
lacp_status: negotiated

slave poct0: enabled
    active slave
    may_enable: true

slave poct1: enabled
    may_enable: true


Now i change priority of poct0, active interface switches to poct1


~ # ovs-vsctl set interface poct0 other_config:lacp-port-priority=4
~ #
~ #
~ # ovs-appctl bond/show bond0
---- bond0 ----
bond_mode: active-backup
bond may use recirculation: no, Recirc-ID : -1
bond-hash-basis: 0
updelay: 0 ms
downdelay: 0 ms
lacp_status: negotiated

slave poct0: enabled
    may_enable: true

slave poct1: enabled
    active slave
    may_enable: true



Please clarify

Thanks,
Prashanth

LINK_DOWN here is still normal behaviour. Since you can see the ARP request on the port, it is safe to assume the port is up.

These parameters look ok, although I'm not sure if the ioeventfd=on parameter is needed.

I've created a similar setup on a Fedora system and I unfortunately I cannot reproduce. I have one bridge, with 1 x dpdkport and 1 x dpdkvhost port, and the same flows; in_port=1,output:2 & in_port=2,output:1
I'm using a traffic generator to simulate the ARP request.
On my guest, I bring up the dpdkvhost Ethernet device, assign it an IP address, and "arp -s <IP of sender of ARP req> <MAC of sender of ARP req>"
When I send the ARP req, I see the response going through the switch and back to the traffic generator.

Potentially there is an issue with your OS, I had a quick look and found a post in the discuss archive about a potential problem with Debian/Ubuntu systems and how they handle ARP packets with OVS: http://openvswitch.org/pipermail/discuss/2012-May/007348.html
It is quite old however so I'm not sure if the issue still exists, or if this is relevant to your set up.

Does the test have an OpenFlow barrier between the flow table change and
the packet?  I'm considering a change to OVS that would make OVS wait
until datapath flows are up-to-date before replying to a barrier
request.

It looks like you misspelled the controller connection name.  Change the
doubled :: to a single : in tcp:172.16.51.1::6633.

Hi all,
Process &&Question discriptions:
1\ I created tens of devices first (using 'ip' tools)
           Using command: ip link add dev group11_0 type veth peer name group11_1
                  etc
2\add port to bridges that I cteated and set the openflow port number menully
     Using command: ovs-vsctl add-br bridge_1
ovs-vsctl add-port bridge_1 group11_0  -- set Interface group11_0 ofport_request=22
etc
3\when repeated step 2 for half the number of the devices have created,error occurred
     Like: ovs-vsctl: Error detected while setting up 'group71_0'.  See ovs-vswitchd log for details.
           seeinglog(/var/run/openvswitch/ovs-vswitchd.log): 2015-06-04T01:28:22Z|57448|netlink_socket|INFO|netlink dump request error (No such file or directory)
4\at the same time ,when used command “ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 show bridge_1”to see the openflow port status,find that there is also no openflow port number created corresponding to the port error occurred.

How could I fix the error?

Ps:
Ovs version&linux kernel version
ovs-vsctl (Open vSwitch) 2.3.1
Linux 2.6.32-431.el6.x86_64
Following is my OVS installation steps:

Hi,
I'd like to know, can I use old ovs-ofctl(wdp codebase) with new OVS(ovs 2.3.0)? And do I need to advertise the OF variant(1.0 or 1.3) to OVS? If yes then how?

Subject: [ovs-discuss] High CPU load (up to 100%) with OVS+DPDK+vHOST usage.
Message-ID: <CAPykWKF=mrQpbC17b4sM07UCowdu2WVt9am1KD71DoE=g1=Cyw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.
I am trying to build VM to VM scheme using Open vSwitch 2.3.9 and DPDK
2.0.0.
After building and installing OVS+DPDK I'm running single bridge with extra
port dpdkvhost type.
I'm using user-defined vhost device called vhost-net1.


#ovs-vswitchd --dpdk --cuse_dev_name vhost-net1 -c 0x01 -n 4 --socket-mem
1024,0 -- unix:/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock --pidfile --detach

014d4a3f-0a8a-4d8f-8fc3-222775266ebf
    Bridge "br10"
        Port "dpdkvhost0"
            Interface "dpdkvhost0"
                type: dpdkvhost
        Port "br10"
            Interface "br10"
                type: internal

Then I'm trying to run single KVM VM using qemu 2.0 (pretty old with
-mem-prealloc option)

#/usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64
 -name qemu_smatov-0 -cpu host -m 2048 -smp 2 -boot once=c -drive
file=/var/lib/libvirt/images/qemu_smatov-0.qcow2 -enable-kvm -net none

virtio-net-pci,netdev=net1,mac=52:54:f1:61:4c:84,csum=off,gso=off,guest_tso4=off,guest_tso6=off,guest_ecn=off

It runs VM, but raises CPU usage up to 100%

Does this usage of CPU expected?

And, btw, does I need any extra guest VM configuration to run ping/iperf?

Yes, this is expected behavior. If you followed INSTALL.DPDK, none of
additional steps are required if the switch itself performing in a
standalone mode.

My understanding is that DPDK always uses 100% CPU, to allow for high
performance.

That is a very strange error.  It indicates something pretty seriously
wrong.  I don't have a good guess as to what, though, because this is
the first time I've seen this error reported.  It makes me wonder
whether you did something really odd, such as running two ovs-vswitchd
processes at once, or removing and reinserting the OVS kernel module
while ovs-vswitchd is running.

I don't recommend using anything from wdp for anything.  It is a dead
branch.  The last commit was over 4 years ago.  It lacks 8,320 commits
found on master.  Don't use it.

Still, ovs-ofctl from wdp should interoperate.

wdp only supports OpenFlow 1.0.

Did you tell Flowvisor and Floodlight to install some entries?

I don't think OVS has a way to specify a priority.

OVS file usage should be pretty stable under normal conditions; that is,
I would not expect it to open an increasing number of files over time.
The exception is if you add more and more ports or bridges over time,
since each port or bridge requires OVS to use more file descriptors.

When you see this, can you take a look at the files that OVS has open?
e.g. "ls -l /proc/$pid/fd" where $pid is the OVS process ID?  It would
also be a good idea to try this with a more recent version of OVS.

Hi!

Working with openvswitch with netctl and I notice a problem when I 
shutdown -r now (strange thing is that I don't have this error when I 
poweroff my unit and start it again in this situation everything is 
working well).
When I shutdown -r now, I am unable to reach my unit, it is like netctl 
tries to add everything again but it has not been deleted correctly before.

Kernel : 4.0.4-2-ARCH
ovs-vsctl (Open vSwitch) 2.3.1
Compiled Dec 12 2014 13:19:48

my netctl configuration :

I'm confused.  It sounds like you're turning off your computer and
complaining that it no longer works.  Presumably this is not what you
are actually doing, can you explain?

Probably you didn't set the OFPVID_PRESENT bit.  The OpenFlow spec says
that's required.

The global interface (ovs-netdev, I think) is really there because the
Linux kernel needs such an interface named after the datapath, for
historical backward compatibility reasons, and we haven't bothered to
remove that for the userspace datapath because it is harmless.

Netlink message formatting is used internally within Open vSwitch even
in the userspace case.

Hi Ben,

I have probably not been too accurate, let me try to explain:
I am using netcl to manage my network connection.
I have created one file in /etc/netctl named vswitch_trust

nano /etc/netctl/vswitch_trust
Description='Trusted Virtual Switch'
Interface=vswitch_trust
Connection=openvswitch
BindsToInterfaces=(eth1 eth2 eth3)
IP=static
Address=('10.20.8.10/24')
#Routes=('192.168.0.0/24 via 192.168.1.2')
Gateway='10.20.8.254'
DNS=('80.67.169.12')

Then I activated it with netctl enable vswitch_trust, then I should be 
able to retrieve everything when my computer boots.
I can confirm that it is working correctly when my computer is poweroff 
and I power on then all my openvswitch configuration came back with the 
information I put on my vswitch_trust file.
The problem is when I am on my computer and decide to do a reboot 
(shutdown -r now), then when the computer is rebooting all the rules are 
back but impossible to ping it not to ping external from the computer.

To summarize when my computer goes from poweroff to power on everything 
is ok but when I decide to reboot the computer then after the reboot my 
interface is not responding at all. (I need to do a manual netctl stop 
vswitch_trust and netctl start vswitch_trust to make it work)

The test is basic.OutputExact in oftest, which is on GitHub at:

https://github.com/floodlight/oftest/blob/master/tests-1.3/basic.py

Yes, it does have a barrier between adding the flow and verifying packets,
so your idea would seem to be not only a total fix, but also the most
elegant way to do it.

To answer Alex in the same email:

1 - Yes, a flow remove would also fix it, although I'm not sure whether
this would make the timing of deleting the dpif flows any faster. But since
we're trying to use oftest without too many mods, and *not* doing the flow
remove actually tests something else (that changing a flow actually changes
the flow), which may in fact be the actual test case we are testing, we
really want this to work without the flow remove.

2 - Not sure exactly where I put the sleep in all cases (I intend to fix
our copy of oftest next week at work and may come up with a different
method anyway), but I think from memory that it's after the call to flow
add.

It's hard for me to guess whether this is an issue related to netctl or
to openvswitch.  It could be either one, but I would be inclined to
consider netctl first because Open vSwitch doesn't have any problems
with reboots when properly integrated to the software that controls it.

Hi Ben,
 so how do we make sure one port is selected as the main port to pass traffic?

Currently in my setup, with active-backup configuration, for example
poct0 and poct1 part of bond0 on both sides.

I am seeing poct0 is selected as the active port. Peer selects poct1
as active port, causing Tx being done on one port and Rx traffic seen
on another port.

Is there a way to make sure both select one port.


Thank you,
Prashanth

This will not work. If you are using the mem-prealloc & associated arguments you mention below,
you will need to use QEMU v1.6.2. If you wish to use a newer version of QEMU than v1.6.2, you will
need to use at least v2.1.0, with the -object memory-backend-file arguments, as documented in
INSTALL.DPDK.md.

Hi Andrey/Sergey,
I had posted some problem I am facing on similar topic as below:

http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network.openvswitch.general/9105

I too observed dpdkhost0 mac of addr:00:00:00:00:00:00 in ovs. I do not 
see packets
sent by VM on this port and seen by ovs (in fact, dump-flows also report 
0 packets).

I am looking for any one opinion on this if dpdkhost0 mac reported is 
expected
(and to quickly debug any other problem there).

I am on qemu 2.1.0 as well.

Thank you,
Gowrishankar

Hi All, 

How can I assign number of cores to datapath/bridges in the system? 
For example, 
I have 12 core machine. 
2 bridges are created using "ovs-vsctl add-br ...." 
I want to assign 2 cores to each of the bridges. 

Is it possible, directly or indirectly? 

Thanks, 
Hardik Soni

The kernel datapath doesn't support that.  It would generally be a
waste, since switching work doesn't use much CPU time in common
situations.

I am not sure that the problem you observing has a same nature as one
described earlier in this topic - by a wild guess it looks like you`ve
missing attachment of a vm` interface to an appropriate file
descriptor. Bringing some bits in (like counters on VM intrerface and
dpdkvhost) would be very helpful. Also I`d suggest you to use a latest
ovs master because it simplified the VM-involved setup even more
lately.

Please read the FAQ.

### Q: What versions of OpenFlow does Open vSwitch support?

A: The following table lists the versions of OpenFlow supported by
   each version of Open vSwitch:

       Open vSwitch      OF1.0  OF1.1  OF1.2  OF1.3  OF1.4  OF1.5
       ###============   =====  =====  =====  =====  =====  =====
       1.9 and earlier    yes    ---    ---    ---    ---    ---
       1.10               yes    ---    [*]    [*]    ---    ---
       1.11               yes    ---    [*]    [*]    ---    ---
       2.0                yes    [*]    [*]    [*]    ---    ---
       2.1                yes    [*]    [*]    [*]    ---    ---
       2.2                yes    [*]    [*]    [*]    [%]    [*]
       2.3                yes    yes    yes    yes    [*]    [*]

       [*] Supported, with one or more missing features.
       [%] Experimental, unsafe implementation.

   Open vSwitch 2.3 enables OpenFlow 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 by default
   in ovs-vswitchd.  In Open vSwitch 1.10 through 2.2, OpenFlow 1.1,
   1.2, and 1.3 must be enabled manually in ovs-vswitchd.  OpenFlow
   1.4 and 1.5 are also supported, with missing features, in Open
   vSwitch 2.3 and later, but not enabled by default.  In any case,
   the user may override the default:

   - To enable OpenFlow 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 on bridge br0:

     ovs-vsctl set bridge br0 protocols=OpenFlow10,OpenFlow11,OpenFlow12,OpenFlow13

   - To enable OpenFlow 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 on bridge br0:

     ovs-vsctl set bridge br0 protocols=OpenFlow10,OpenFlow11,OpenFlow12,OpenFlow13,OpenFlow14,OpenFlow15

   - To enable only OpenFlow 1.0 on bridge br0:

     ovs-vsctl set bridge br0 protocols=OpenFlow10

   All current versions of ovs-ofctl enable only OpenFlow 1.0 by
   default.  Use the -O option to enable support for later versions of
   OpenFlow in ovs-ofctl.  For example:

       ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows br0

   (Open vSwitch 2.2 had an experimental implementation of OpenFlow
   1.4 that could cause crashes.  We don't recommend enabling it.)

   [OPENFLOW-1.1+.md] in the Open vSwitch source tree tracks support for
   OpenFlow 1.1 and later features.  When support for OpenFlow 1.4 and
   1.5 is solidly implemented, Open vSwitch will enable those version
   by default.  Also, the OpenFlow 1.5 specification is still under
   development and thus subject to change.

An active-backup bond is meant to be connected to a MAC-learning switch,
which should not have a bond configured.

Thanks for your reply.
If I remember well openvswitch keeps the configuration even after a 
reboot, perhaps the issue is caused by netctl which tries to erase 
everything again? (then if it is the case it should have a difference 
between reboot and starting from a cold start).

By the way speaking about netctl I am using this :

nano /etc/netctl/vswitch_trust
Description='Trusted Virtual Switch'
Interface=vswitch_trust
Connection=openvswitch
BindsToInterfaces=(eth1 eth2 eth3)
IP=static
Address=('10.20.8.10/24')
#Routes=('192.168.0.0/24 via 192.168.1.2')
Gateway='10.20.8.254'
DNS=('80.67.169.12')

Do you know if it is possible to indicate some vlan tag for eth1 eth2 
eth3 directly in netctl conf?
I am asking this because apparently openvswitch is supported as I am 
using Connection=openvswitch.

Many thanks

Ben

It could be.  OVS can be started in a mode where it retains the previous
configuration after reboot, or in one where it deletes the bridges on
reboot.  In the latter mode, one passes --delete-bridges to the ovs-ctl
script.

I don't use netctl.  I recommend asking about netctl on a mailing list
specialized for it.

Okay. I understand that switching doesnt take much time. 
But what about flowtable update in kernel datapath from userspace.

I was not elaborate in my question, I have following scenario.
I want to run 2 ovs-switch instances on single machine. But, they should not affect each other's performance.
So, I thought if I can assign # of physical cores to them..
I am using Open Vswitch with kernel module.

Thanks,
Hardik Soni

I believe that you can do that if you run them in different network
namespaces.  Container systems such as Docker might be a reasonable way
to do that.

Message-ID: <DUB127-W2D0E12EA66EF3BAE259D4C6B20@phx.gbl>




Hi,
I am trying to configure QoS on OVS, running on mininet network.

I install a PRIO qdisc on an interface with the command

tc qdisc add dev s1-eth4 root handle 1: prio

and then the classes 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 are automatically created.

The problem is that every user flow passing from that interface now has the whole interface capacity.

E.g. 3 user TCP flows pass from this interface (link of capacity 10Mbps), everyone
is served with 10Mbps...that is impossible. With htb qdisc (also if configured with tc commands)
there are no problems.

Thank you very much
Best regards

  Before reinserting a new ovs kernel module(using insmod openvswitch.ko) every time ,I just rmmoded the openvswitch.ko first.Is this right?
  How to stop the running ovs-vswitchd?

That is a very strange error.  It indicates something pretty seriously wrong.  I don't have a good guess as to what, though, because this is the first time I've seen this error reported.  It makes me wonder whether you did something really odd, such as running two ovs-vswitchd processes at once, or removing and reinserting the OVS kernel module while ovs-vswitchd is running.

Hi,


While trying to encrypt(IPsec policy) packets  based on GRE key

OVS bridge. The packets forwarded to Desination unencrypted.
Kernel treats packet having different keys as same flow type.

I don't recommend using anything from wdp for anything.  It is a dead
branch.  The last commit was over 4 years ago.  It lacks 8,320 commits
found on master.  Don't use it.

Still, ovs-ofctl from wdp should interoperate.

wdp only supports OpenFlow 1.0.

Hi Ben,

As below ,I have got more details about the problem.
 
1\ the total number of ports added to OVS bridge successfully is fixed. only when deleted one port(using ovs-vsctl del-port bridge_1 group11_0),another port could be added.
2\ when I set the veth interfaces as internal mode (ovs-vsctl set Interface group12_0 type=internal),all the ports can be added to the OVS bridge successfully. but openflow port number can`t be created at this time.

Best regards
Wei Shen

It seems that you are not using ovs-monitor-ipsec to install IPsec
policies for you?

I think this could be classified as bug for those use cases when one
wants to install such fine grained IPsec policies based on GRE key.
BTW I looked in ip-xfrm man page and it has more fields in SELECTOR.

Hi Ben,

Thanks for taking your time with this and other questions. Fortunately,
it was the custom code not closing properly a sockets we use. I disabled
our modifications and it became stable again, so it is internal business
now.

As a reference, I used two programs to monitor the number of open file
descriptors:

# Number of FD owned by ovs
lsof | grep ovs-vswitchd | wc -l

# Total FD amount and related figures
sysctl fs.file-nr | awk '{print $3}'

More dettail here

Hi,
I am using the following setup to test interface bonding with OVS.

VM1         |       VM2

(10.10.10.2/16)     (10.10.10.3/16)
    eth1 ========== eth1
   /                                 \
  /                                   \
bond0                              bond0
  \                                   /
   \                                 /
    eth2 ========== eth2
(10.10.20.2/16)     (10.10.20.3/16)

I can see that -
1. lacp status is negotiated
2. On both VMs initially eth1 is enabled and eth2 is the active slave

Is my assumption wrong that I should be able to ping either of the
bonded interfaces in VM2 from VM1?
- ping shows that the currently active interface is used to send out requests.
- tcpdump shows that the arp requests are received by the active
interface in VM2. No reply is generated.

Can anyone please explain what is wrong in my
configuration/expectation that arp request should generate a response
in this configuration?

Thanks,
Nagaravind

Subject: [ovs-discuss] OVSDB updates, IDL consistency
Message-ID: <CAEgOKCyi5w-0mcwNDtaMN+_XPw1h_DyG0puTrD5qkMgzRyL5BQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

When OVSDB server sends updates to an OVSDB client, the IDL changes
idl_seqno. When idl_seqno changes, the client can rebrowse the IDL and look
for changes.

Does OVSDB server guarantee that the updates always maintain referential
integrity for row creation and row updates i.e. if the client browses the
IDL it should never run into a situation where rowA in tableA points to a
non-existent rowB in tableB because the update for rowA has arrived but
update for rowB is still in flight.

If the OVSDB server doesnt guarantee the above, what should the client do
to make sure that IDL is in a consistent state before it is browsed.

Thanks

Hi Ciara,

I switched to Fedora (22) and could get dpdkvhost functioning for VM. I 
could see ARP and
ICMP flying between VM (through dpdkvhost0 - cuse) and remote system 
connected to dpdk0,
but tcp (whether syn or syn-ack) from VM on dpdkvhost0 getting dropped 
inside ovs, it seems.

This problem was discussed earlier in ovs community:
http://openvswitch.org/pipermail/discuss/2015-May/017681.html

I am checking if this is finally fixed in dpdk upstream, after below 
discussion. Anyone aware of ?
http://dpdk.org/ml/archives/dev/2015-May/017919.html

dpdk version of my setup is 2.0.0.

ovs-vsctl (Open vSwitch) 2.3.90
Compiled Jun 10 2015 09:03:00
DB Schema 7.12.1
commit bdd7ecf5bfc4a255872aa60057b3b96f72b47d8a on May/29.

Is tcp working over dpdk 2.0.0 source otherwise (while integrated with 
current ovs-master) ?

Thanks,
Gowri Shankar

The flow extractor is bailing out because the IPv6 packet claims a
length longer than the actual space in the packet.

Thanks Ben. I have seen that when a transaction is deleting rowA which
points to rowB which points to rowC, and if all the references to rowB and
rowC are gone, the updates generated can be in any order ie rowC delete can
be received before deletes for rowA or rowB. Should this be expected for
"deletes"?

An example of where deletes are received out of order: Mcast_Macs_Remote
points to Physical_Locator_Set which points to Physical_Locator. When a
transaction deletes Mcast_Macs_Remote, delete for Physical_Locator_Set is
received first.

It looks like this was already fixed with commit
b953042214201e2693a485a8ba8b19f69e5bdf34 ("datapath: simplify sample
action implementation" on branch-2.3. However, this has not yet been
part of a release. I expect that 2.3.2 will be released soon
containing this fix.

No, ovs-monitor-ipsec can't be used used to install IPsec policies
that match on GRE key.

Pravin told me that he will look into this patch before applying.

One small comment - if gre KEY is not set, shouldn't we set it to 0
instead of leaving unset before performing route lookup?

Subject: [ovs-discuss] force-reload-kmod and bonding
Message-ID: <CAC=Vi+o9Z6X3opSVvHdFXruVdS43=6rCuxXTo+z+TG9-2Hhj1Q@mail.gmail.com>

When testing force-reload-kmod on XenServer 6.2 running OVS 2.1/2.3 with
bonded LACP configurations, the disruption to data plane connectivity is
much longer than non-bonded configurations.

While debugging, one area that longer than expected was in the dp-ctl
del-dp calls[1]. The earlier dump-dps call only returned "system at ovs-system
".

I straced the calls and was surprised with this call taking over 3s:

https://gist.github.com/andyhky/b531751f00c5ca94ae24#file-bonded-L197

But non bonded <1s:

https://gist.github.com/andyhky/b531751f00c5ca94ae24#file-non-bonded-L196

Repeated testing on different bonded servers all took between 3s-5s.
Testing on non-bonded servers was always ~1s.

Within 1s of the del-dp command running, traffic drops from the host. Does
anyone have ideas on why this would take so much longer on a bonded
configuration?

The updates you're showing me might not be related to the transaction at
all, since the update doesn't mention the Mcast_Macs_Remote table.
Where's the transaction reply?

If the deletes are within a single transaction, they'll be reported as
part of a single update, and the IDL will present them all together as a
unit.

If the deletes happen in different transactions then they'll be reported
sequentially, in the same order they were applied to the database.

If you're actually seeing different behavior then I'd like a
reproduction case; that shouldn't happen.

Subject: [ovs-discuss] New test case - it fails

I confess that I have no idea what your response means! The packet I am
using in that test is cribbed from another test "ofproto-dpif - Neighbor
Discovery set-field with checksum update", and does appear to have the
desired result, it create a dpif flow, just not the right one.

The testsuite.log file contains:
-recirc_id(0),in_port(1),eth_type(0x86dd),ipv6(proto=58,frag=no),icmpv6(code=3),
packets:0, bytes:0, used:never,
actions:userspace(pid=0,slow_path(controller))
+recirc_id(0),in_port(1),eth_type(0x86dd),ipv6(proto=58,frag=no),
packets:0, bytes:0, used:never,
actions:userspace(pid=0,slow_path(controller))

I think this is a result of this piece of code (flow.c, flow_wc_map)
    } else if (flow->dl_type == htons(ETH_TYPE_IPV6)) {
        map |= MINIFLOW_MAP(ipv6_src) | MINIFLOW_MAP(ipv6_dst)
            | MINIFLOW_MAP(ipv6_label)
            | MINIFLOW_MAP(nw_proto) | MINIFLOW_MAP(nw_frag)
            | MINIFLOW_MAP(nw_tos) | MINIFLOW_MAP(nw_ttl);
        if (OVS_UNLIKELY(flow->nw_proto == IPPROTO_ICMPV6)) {
            map |= MINIFLOW_MAP(nd_target)
                | MINIFLOW_MAP(arp_sha) | MINIFLOW_MAP(arp_tha);
        } else {
            map |= MINIFLOW_MAP(tcp_flags)
                | MINIFLOW_MAP(tp_src) | MINIFLOW_MAP(tp_dst);
        }
    } else if (eth_type_mpls(flow->dl_type)) {

which could look better as:
    } else if (flow->dl_type == htons(ETH_TYPE_IPV6)) {
        map |= MINIFLOW_MAP(ipv6_src) | MINIFLOW_MAP(ipv6_dst)
            | MINIFLOW_MAP(ipv6_label)
            | MINIFLOW_MAP(nw_proto) | MINIFLOW_MAP(nw_frag)
            | MINIFLOW_MAP(nw_tos) | MINIFLOW_MAP(nw_ttl);
        map |= MINIFLOW_MAP(tp_src) | MINIFLOW_MAP(tp_dst);
        if (OVS_UNLIKELY(flow->nw_proto == IPPROTO_ICMPV6)) {
            if (OVS_UNLIKELY(flow->tp_dst == 0 &&
                             (flow->tp_src == ND_NEIGHBOR_SOLICIT ||
                              flow->tp_src == ND_NEIGHBOR_ADVERT))) {
                map |= MINIFLOW_MAP(nd_target)
                    | MINIFLOW_MAP(arp_sha) | MINIFLOW_MAP(arp_tha);
            }
        } else {
            map |= MINIFLOW_MAP(tcp_flags);
        }
    } else if (eth_type_mpls(flow->dl_type)) {

based on functionally similar code a few hundred lines down in the same
file.

The first time I tried a fix it caused some TCP and UDP tests to fail,
hence my question about how many test cases would be appropriate here. I
don't want to write a bunch of test cases until I'm happy that I'm writing
them correctly.

Just to be clear, even though I originally found this on our platform (with
code modifications by us), I am writing and running this test on a clean
clone of the repo, with no other mods.

Cheers
Tony

The transaction reply appears after all the updates are received (but I
dont have those traces at this time)

Here is the good case where all the changes to the database come in one
giant update instead of split up into 3 updates. Note that in the bad case
the 3 row deletes appeared as 3 different updates. I think the issue is
that sometimes the server will split up the updates.

good case:

The database server should always report a single transaction as a
single update.  It can sometimes merge multiple transactions into one
update but it's a bug if it ever splits a single transaction into
multiple updates.

Is this with bleeding-edge OVS from master, by any chance?  We've had a
lot of churn in that code over the last month or so, so new bugs are
possible.  (Before that, though, it is basically unchanged for years.)

I'd love a reproduction case.

This happens with an older (more than 6 month) OVSDB server. It is
difficult to reproduce this behaviour.

Hi Tony,

Great, we always develop against the tip of master.

Yes, this is an appropriate file. I've also alternatively used
tests/dpif-netdev.at for testing userspace datapath behaviour like
this.

There is no end-quote on the netdev-dummy line, which suggests that
this is probably not identical to the test that you were running
locally. A common problem is that your email client is messing with
the patch. git format-patch (and git send-email) do a great job of
ensuring that a patch you've committed locally is sent in the correct
format.

Typically if I want to determine whether a datapath flow was installed
correctly, I will do something like the following:

- Increase log level at the beginning of the test (after vswitchd start)
AT_CHECK([ovs-appctl vlog/set dpif:dbg dpif_netdev:dbg])

- use FILTER_FLOW_INSTALL
AT_CHECK([cat ovs-vswitchd.log | grep 'in_port=[[1]]' |
FILTER_FLOW_INSTALL | STRIP_XOUT], [0], [dnl
<flow>
]

This alleviates some issues with test script race conditions when
running the tests on a highly-loaded system (or highly-parallel). You
can see some examples in the same test file; the macro is defined in
tests/dpif-netdev.at.

I suspect if we'd thought of particular additional cases, we would
have added them. If there are more problems that oftest is showing up,
fixing those bugs and adding tests to show that the fix works would be
appropriate. Generally the CI we use (eg travis) doesn't run the
oftest framework, so this would be a way to ensure that there aren't
regressions in areas like this.

I noticed that if you apply something similar to the patch below on
branch-2.3 (complete with truncated packet), the datapath flow that's
generated still includes the icmp code (and seems fine). Yet on the
latest master that doesn't seem to be the case. Is that what you've
noticed? That seems like potentially a regression or change in the
behaviour since v2.3. Perhaps because the truncated packet doesn't
include a valid ICMPv6 option, so the newer OVS doesn't even parse the
type and/or code. (I haven't looked particularly close at the packet
you're using; I cheated with an online hexdump decoder)

I have a pile of patches that fix a lot of bugs found by oftest (and
another pile that fixes bugs in oftest), which I have not yet posted,
but I don't remember anything like this showing up.

The commit that introduced flow_wc_map is dated 18/Oct/2014. I notice that
flow.c does not have any commits after Jun/2014 in the 2.3 branch, so that
explains why Joe hasn't seen the issue in that branch.

I'll take Joe's advice and try to clean up the test and submit it to the
delivery mailing list.

The packet is just one from the neighbor discovery test with type and code
changed. I'll try to make it more well-formed. Your comment about closing
quote probably explains Ben's original comment, I'll play around with that
tonight.

It's probably a long-standing bug then.

Does the problem seem correlated with a high transaction rate on the
database server, or does it happen even at a low to medium pace?  Do you
have other hints to what might trigger the issue?

QEMU 2.0 will not work with dpdkvhost ports, you cannot use it.
I get the same error as this when I try to use QEMU 2.0, you need to use QEMU 2.1 or later.

Yes it should, but only if you use QEMU v2.1 or later. Use this same command with QEMU v2.1 and your VM should boot.

Subject: [ovs-discuss] Flows unmodified after clearing mirror
Message-ID: <CABZU2_RMiqGPULEsmt1VQx9vwocCzQY4bZ3qgMd0W6D2U7izxA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
 i am trying SPAN in openvswitch 2.3.0, by mirroring source traffic of
oct0 to output on port oct1.

After i start traffic, i can see packets in oct1. While  traffic is
running, i cleared the mirror. But still see mirroring happening.
Mirroring stops only after i stop and start traffic again. is this a
bug?


Mirror creation:

ovs-vsctl -- set Bridge br0 mirrors=@m  -- --id=@h0 get Port oct0  --
--id=@h1 get Port oct1  -- --id=@m create Mirror name=mymirror
select-src-p
ort=@h0 output-port=@h1
dc075662-e0f6-406f-a8e6-142ccbbdc287
~ #

Flows  with mirroring:

Subject: [ovs-discuss] VMs can't ping each other
Message-ID: <CAEFdjR04wrp5MB5H7X6deDEVXBCN62s9C0VJr1oVZ9NGGp=-2A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I have a server with several VMs. One of these acts as my OVS. The others
are connected to it through bridges. It means that eth1 of each VM is
connected to the eth-x of the OVS.
I have also put an ODL Controller who is able to detect the network.
When I try to ping from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.2 I receive the message
"Destination host unreachble".
I dumped the traffic and I can see that the arp request arrives to the
destination, the arp reply is sent but it never reaches the switch.
According to your knoledge, could be that it is blocked in some way by the
bridge?

If you need further information feel free to contact me.
Thanks
Regards,

Hi Ben,

I¹m still not there yet. But I did see this commit,
19aef6ef26d36511d820e3e629c57df59eb0941d

auto-attach: Implement interface lldp disable and re-enable

This commit completes the implementation of the lldp enable
option. Specifically after enabling lldp on a particular interface, lldp
can
now be disabled and subsequently re-enabled. OVS will not transmit or
receive
lldp packets if lldp is disabled on the interface



When will there be another OVS release, so I can pick this up.

I¹m trying to pull the latest code and build an RPM following this,
https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/blob/master/INSTALL.RHEL.md

But this web page I think only converts a released OVS into an RPM?

Thanks,

‹Dave

Subject: [ovs-discuss] Support for arp requests with bonding
Message-ID: <CAJYsdDgOT_z+4SeORipETet8Q4N8CRhfKXsGxbCqRnZkqwzW-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am using the following setup to test interface bonding with OVS.

VM1         |       VM2

(10.10.10.2/16)     (10.10.10.3/16)
    eth1 ========== eth1
   /                                 \
  /                                   \
bond0                              bond0
  \                                   /
   \                                 /
    eth2 ========== eth2
(10.10.20.2/16)     (10.10.20.3/16)

I can see that -
1. lacp status is negotiated
2. On both VMs initially eth1 is enabled and eth2 is the active slave

Is my assumption wrong that I should be able to ping either of the
bonded interfaces in VM2 from VM1?
- ping shows that the currently active interface is used to send out requests.
- tcpdump shows that the arp requests are received by the active
interface in VM2. No reply is generated.

Can anyone please explain what is wrong in my configuration?

Thanks,
Nagaravind

Message-ID: <CAJ9ww9hBZtXBftFKqepa7ZfCxhQUaAHOcd5vB2PWtCFEDfwG4g@mail.gmail.com>

To whom it may concern,
Do to some research I need to install openvswitch 1.4.3 in unbuntu 12.04
with kernel 3.2.0-77-generic amd 64.  ./configure
--with-linux=/lib/modules/3.2.0-77-generic/build. During make I received
the following error.

/home/pads/Desktop/sdn/openvswitch-1.4.3/datapath/linux/tunnel.c:1294:3:
error: too many arguments to function ‘ip_select_ident’
include/net/ip.h:291:20: note: declared here
make[5]: ***
[/home/pads/Desktop/sdn/openvswitch-1.4.3/datapath/linux/tunnel.o] Error 1

As a result, no .ko file was created. From online I see that openvswitch
1.4.3 support kernel version up to 3.2. Is my kernel version still too
high? Will kernel version 3.1 work better? Thank you.

Hi Ansis,

 I used "ip xfrm add policy" command to add policy.
I have not used "ovs-monitor-ipsec".Can it be used to encryt based on GRE key?.
I tested with GRE key value only.I will test weather Port no, based
filtering is supported in OVS or not and revert.

Hi Ben,

Thank you. I really appreciate your help.

Use the lsof command to find out that ovs-swtichd process has run out of the file descriptors when errors happened. 
Then I changed the system-wide maximum number of file handles from 1024 to 65535. The errors were fixed finally.

Best regards.
Wei Shen

Hello Ciara Loftus!

Thank you for the information.
The reason I'm using 2.0 qemu is that on newest versions following
INSTALL.DPDK.md I've received following error

ERROR:/build/buildd/qemu-2.0.0+dfsg/qom/object.c:437:object_new_with_type:

While using this command

/usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64

It's blocked me to configure appropriate VM attached to file descriptor.

Does the configuration above correct to launch VM instance?

Hi,

Can anyone tell how I can use the learn action to change the priority of an
existing flow-entry?

Best,

Message-ID: <CAC0L=vXOHxBPUpaWL_Jikbp92Jj+P_3ZDuKPO8=wmH73cKujPw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I was wondering if some of the devs can help on this one. I am unsure if
this is a bug but I figured I should check with you guys just in case. I
have attached a copy of my topology to this email to better illustrate what
the problem is. I have also attached it to the bottom of this email.

The OVS version I am running is 1.11.0. However I have seen the exact same
behavior using version 2.1.3. I am running cent 6.5 in both environments
with a 2.6.32-431.29.2.el6.x86_64 kernel. I have also tried with the most
up to date kernel and still seeing the same issue.

Am I doing something wrong in my setup? Any information would be greatly
appreciated.

It looks like people have seen this behavior before, refer to the links
below.

Hi,

I was wondering if you could help me figuring out where the algorithm for
the group type "select" is implemented in ovs switch files? I want to
implement a function which takes the hash of the src/dst ip, and src/dst
port and selects the corresponding bucket for the packet.

Best,

Hi,
I am trying to understand how OVS updates group counters. But I am not able to find the group action in OVS code. Can you please point me how the group (bucket) counters are updated in OVS?
Openflow specification talks about group actions in Section 5.10 of OpenflowSpecification1.3.But I am not able to find the corresponding implementation in OVS code.
Thanks in advance,Saif

On current master, it happens in xlate_push_stats() in
ofproto-dpif-xlate.c.

At a guess, without looking at code, I'd think that RCU synchronization
on removal from a datapath is costly for physical Ethernet devices and
that it multiples across the number of them present in the datapath.
Pravin, does this make any sense (or do you have another idea)?

Are you just reporting how the prio qdisc works, or are you talking
about some interaction between OVS and the prio qdisc?

What is the current ovs version using for select type? As far as I could
understand it is taking a xor of src and destination addresses and tcp
ports? Is it correct?

Perhaps I'm completely misunderstanding what you're trying to accomplish here, but as I understand it you'd want the IP address assigned to the bond, not the individual interfaces that are members of the bond.

Andy/Scott,
Thanks for your responses. My initial understanding was wrong. I
should have assigned the IP to the bridge and not the individual
interfaces.

The default is a hash (not just an xor) over fields up to L4, but you
can configure another method using the extensions implemented by
Netronome.

Please don't drop the mailing list.

Are you sure Mininet isn't interfering?  It also sets up QoS.

Are you directing packets to queues?

### Q: I configured Quality of Service (QoS) in my OpenFlow network by
   adding records to the QoS and Queue table, but the results aren't
   what I expect.

A: Did you install OpenFlow flows that use your queues?  This is the
   primary way to tell Open vSwitch which queues you want to use.  If
   you don't do this, then the default queue will be used, which will
   probably not have the effect you want.

   Refer to the previous question for an example.

We wanted to provide a quick update on the plan for the next couple releases.  OVS 2.4 is shaping up to be a big release with a number of great new features people are anxious to use. Some of the highlights include:

	- Native Linux kernel STT support
	- Geneve tunneling
	- DPDK vhost and tunneling
	- OpenFlow 1.4 bundles (flow transactions)
	- Bash command completion
	- RSTP
	- Multicast snooping
	- Support for Linux kernels up to 4.0.x

The plan is to branch early next week and have an official release ready roughly six weeks after that.

We originally had planned to release OVS 2.4 when the new connection tracking features were merged into the upstream kernel. Unfortunately, this has taken longer than we anticipated.  We feel we are making progress on that front, and once support is added, we will follow it up quickly with another release, which will likely be the next LTS.  

Finally, on the subject of LTS, we plan to release OVS 2.3.2 next week, which contains a number of bug fixes.

Happy switching!

Correct.  Connection tracking was this part of the announcement:

We feel we are making progress on that front, and once support is added, we will follow it up quickly with another release, which will likely be the next LTS.

The release of 2.4 won't really affect when connection tracking comes to an OVS release; we just didn't want to continue having it block the release of other useful features.  As soon as we can do a release with connection tracking, we will.

I don't know what stateful NA is.  Did you mean NAT?  If so, that was something being worked on by Thomas Graf, but he hasn't given a timeline.

Subject: [ovs-discuss] displaying ethernet mac addr in dpif/dump-flows
Message-ID: <557AB9EE.6080907@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

Hi,
Sometimes back, while checking datapath flows for my bridge br0, I had 
noticed src and dst mac been listed as below in eth().

ovs-appctl dpif/dump-flows br0
recirc_id(0),in_port(3),eth(src=00:02:c9:4c:e6:e2,dst=33:33:00:00:00:02),eth_type(0x86dd),ipv6(frag=no), 
packets:1418, bytes:87916, used:0.268s, actions:2,1,4
...

Not sure whether I turned on some debug setting within switch, as I had 
been checking with appctl vlog/list console and file settings.
Following restart of ovsdb server and daemon process, now I do not see 
those eth() info.

ovs-appctl dpif/dump-flows br0
recirc_id(0),in_port(2),eth_type(0x86dd),ipv6(frag=no), packets:245, 
bytes:15190, used:6.644s, actions:3

Any help to get back same verbose level in dpif/dump-flows is appreciated.

Checking code, I see -m helping me to see all fields wildcarded by flow. 
Anyway, helpful to know if there is any other setting controlling it.

Subject: [ovs-discuss] Upcall to userspace threading question
Message-ID: <alpine.LSU.2.11.1506120827260.27561@ybpnyubfg>

Currently flow setup is done in a round-robin manner based on port to 
prevent the possibility of a denial of service attack.  However, in a 
situation where all GRE tunnels terminate on a single port (specifically 
in the case of an L3 node under Openstack) it seems to make sense to 
further split the flow setup from a single port to prevent the 
possibility of a similar DoS attack that affects the GRE traffic.

Has this split been considered, and if so are there reasons that it 
wasn't implemented?


Somewhat related, when an action list contains a sample action it causes 
the packet to be cloned and sent to userspace. The way I read it the 
samples share the same upcall path as flow setup upcalls. Given that 
sampling would be pushing larger packets into the upcall path, compared 
to SYNs during flow setup, I assume that if the sampling rate were too 
aggressive that this could lead to a full upcall queue which would have 
a negative impact on other traffic.

Has there been any thought given to splitting the sampling upcalls from 
the rest of the upcall "traffic?"


Thanks,
Scott

It's a hash, so it's probabilistic.  You'll only get a statistically
even distribution if you have a large number of flows.  For two flows,
there is a 50% chance they end up in the same bucket.

Can you provide the entire ovs-ofctl command?

Try this (note that configuring the selection method only works with the
experimental OpenFlow 1.5 protocol):

utilities/ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow15 add-group br0 group_id=1,type=select,selection_method=hash,bucket=output:2,bucket=output:3

Make sure you're using OVS from master.

I don't know of any conflicts on those dates, but if possible it would
be awesome if it got shifted by 1 or 2 days so that it didn't require
traveling over the weekend.

Oh, I didn't even think of that.  We might be already too far along our
scheduling process (it really is happening) to change it for this year,
but for next year I'll try for Tuesday/Wednesday instead of
Monday/Tuesday.

This isn't entirely true any more (it used to be). Each port now has
an array of sockets that packets can be queued to and flows are spread
among them based on a hash of the flow.

It's possible to implement this given the existing kernel
infrastructure but I haven't heard this being an issue before and so
nobody has bothered to do it to the best of my knowledge. Other types
of control packets - STP, CFM, etc. - are sent to a separate queue.

Thanks, this helps. The backtrace suggested there is a stack
corruption from 'execute_recirc()',  But it not
obvious what is the problem.  I will need to think about it more. In
the mean time, would you please post
a snap shot of the datapath flows,  using the 'ovs-dpctl dump-flows' command.

Thanks,

Subject: [ovs-discuss] OVS 2.4 Release Plans

We wanted to provide a quick update on the plan for the next couple releases.  OVS 2.4 is shaping up to be a big release with a number of great new features people are anxious to use. Some of the highlights include:

	- Native Linux kernel STT support
	- Geneve tunneling
	- DPDK vhost and tunneling
	- OpenFlow 1.4 bundles (flow transactions)
	- Bash command completion
	- RSTP
	- Multicast snooping
	- Support for Linux kernels up to 4.0.x

The plan is to branch early next week and have an official release ready roughly six weeks after that.

We originally had planned to release OVS 2.4 when the new connection tracking features were merged into the upstream kernel. Unfortunately, this has taken longer than we anticipated.  We feel we are making progress on that front, and once support is added, we will follow it up quickly with another release, which will likely be the next LTS.  

Finally, on the subject of LTS, we plan to release OVS 2.3.2 next week, which contains a number of bug fixes.

Happy switching!

I predict that they won't make it into 2.4 but will make it into 2.5.

2.4 has been a long time coming. Should we expect 2.5 to take a year too or might it be by the end of this year?

2.4 has taken too long.  We want to switch to time-based releases.  The
target is 3-4 times per year.

I was not able to reproduce the bug on my setup and did not find
anything obvious that will corrupt memory. I have not figured out what
I can do to narrow this down further.

Can you reliably reproduce it? If yes, will you be able to narrow it
down further at your end?

The following information may be tangentially useful:
Does this only happen on one kernel version?  If yes which one. Have
your tried more than one version of the kernel?
Any local changes to either Linux kernel or OVS?
Have you tried with more one distribution?

Hi，Andy,

Thanks for your response.

We did some local changes to Linux kernel and OVS. 
I will do more tests to narrow it down according to your advice, and let you know if I have any further progress.

Thanks again!

I was not able to reproduce the bug on my setup and did not find
anything obvious that will corrupt memory. I have not figured out what
I can do to narrow this down further.

Can you reliably reproduce it? If yes, will you be able to narrow it
down further at your end?

The following information may be tangentially useful:
Does this only happen on one kernel version?  If yes which one. Have
your tried more than one version of the kernel?
Any local changes to either Linux kernel or OVS?
Have you tried with more one distribution?

Subject: [ovs-discuss] MPLS bug in Ubuntu 14.04
Message-ID: <5580465C.60308@uniroma2.it>

Hi,

we are not able to push MPLS labels (even a single one) in Ubuntu 
14.04.1 LTS, with kernel 3.13.0-34 using open vswitch 2.390 (master branch)

previously it was working, for example we have no problem with kernel 
3.8.0-35 (in which we were also able to push multiple MPLS label)

as a simple test scenario, we use a mininet topology with 2 hosts and 
one ovs-kernel switch

H1 ----> SW -----> H2

SW is supposed to take ingress traffic from H1, push one MPLS label and 
forward to H2

the rules are installed in OVS and visible with ofctl, but when a packet 
enters the switch from H1, the packet is not forwarded (while the 
statistics are increased) and the following error is logged in 
ovs-vswitchd log:

2015-06-16T11:38:08.448Z|00179|dpif(handler9)|WARN|system at ovs-system:

Subject: [ovs-discuss] How to convert a trunk port to an access port?
Message-ID: <20150616214317.GA21741@shell.dmz.bit.nl>

Hi list,

I followed the "FAQ" to change a "tagged / trunk" port to an "access
port":


If you want to configure an already added port as an access port, use
"ovs-vsctl set", e.g.:

   ovs-vsctl set port tap0 tag=9

However, the port (vnet) keeps the "trunks=vid" entry, and gets another
"tag=vid" entry. Example:

Bridge uplink
        Port "vnet6"
            tag: 226             <--- added by set port command
            trunks: [226, 227]
            Interface "vnet6"

Is the above configuration for port "vnet6" equivalent to a "native vlan" (native-untagged)? How
can one convert a trunk port to an "access port"

Thanks,

Stefan Kooman

Message-ID: <1776455955.1559499.1434092338708.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,          I have a misunderstanding withe the source code. In "openvswitch.h"  under "ovs_action_attr" the action types defined does not adhere to the openflow specification : openflow-spec-v1.1.0  (the implemented version, at least that's what it says), specifically the group action (which is a required action) has not been defined and so it has'nt been implemented  do_execute_actions as well so how can a packet access group actions from the datapath. However there is the implementation in the control path with the OFPGC11_ADD, etc . please do help me with this dilemma. Thanks :)

My topology is two hosts connected to a switch and I am sending two flows
from host 1 to host 2. What I want to do is use the select group type with
two different buckets. But both of my flows are being mapped to one bucket,
essentially. Shouldn't the select function, which is taking a hash of
src/dst ports and ips, map each blow to different bucket?

Yes, tested it with more flows a while ago and it was working fine! I tried
giving selection_method=hash with the group type select. Ovs-ofctl telling
me unknown keyword. Why is that?

Yes I tried it with -O OpenFlow15 but it said the same.

Sorry I missed the switch name in the previous command.
ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow15 add-group
s1 group_id=1,type=select,selection_method=hash,bucket=output:2,bucket=output:3

It seems problems are resolved. Now I got VM to VM traffic.
I've moved to 14.10 Ubuntu and 2.1.0 qemu. Pulled latest OVS and there was
simple vhost-user guide.

Thanks a lot Ciara Loftus for OVS vhost-user commit, it was so much easier.
Thanks Andrey for helping.

The actions implemented in the kernel are related to but not the same
as OpenFlow actions. In general they are simpler and not tied to
particular OpenFlow versions. Userspace can use these primitives to
implement OpenFlow.

HI Every one,

I want to enable Promiscuous mode in OVS so that on a port of my choice I
can listen to the traffic being passed through OVS. How is this possible?

Thanking you in advance.

This is a FAQ.

### Q: Does Open vSwitch support configuring a port in promiscuous mode?

A: Yes.  How you configure it depends on what you mean by "promiscuous
   mode":

  - Conventionally, "promiscuous mode" is a feature of a network
    interface card.  Ordinarily, a NIC passes to the CPU only the
    packets actually destined to its host machine.  It discards
    the rest to avoid wasting memory and CPU cycles.  When
    promiscuous mode is enabled, however, it passes every packet
    to the CPU.  On an old-style shared-media or hub-based
    network, this allows the host to spy on all packets on the
    network.  But in the switched networks that are almost
    everywhere these days, promiscuous mode doesn't have much
    effect, because few packets not destined to a host are
    delivered to the host's NIC.

    This form of promiscuous mode is configured in the guest OS of
    the VMs on your bridge, e.g. with "ifconfig".

  - The VMware vSwitch uses a different definition of "promiscuous
    mode".  When you configure promiscuous mode on a VMware vNIC,
    the vSwitch sends a copy of every packet received by the
    vSwitch to that vNIC.  That has a much bigger effect than just
    enabling promiscuous mode in a guest OS.  Rather than getting
    a few stray packets for which the switch does not yet know the
    correct destination, the vNIC gets every packet.  The effect
    is similar to replacing the vSwitch by a virtual hub.

    This "promiscuous mode" is what switches normally call "port
    mirroring" or "SPAN".  For information on how to configure
    SPAN, see "How do I configure a port as a SPAN port, that is,
    enable mirroring of all traffic to that port?"

Do you also see such large error counts from "ifconfig"?

Thanks, this works like a charm.

I would like to understand what functionality a mixed "tagged" and
"trunk" port provide? As far as I can see (tcpdump) the traffic bound for the
vnet (tap port) never reaches it's destination anymore after being
tagged (although being a trunk port as well). Shouldn't these modes be mutually
exclusive? I'm running an experimental "nested" virtualization solution:

hypervisor config (L0):

Port "vnet6"
            tag: 226
            trunks: [226, 227]
            Interface "vnet6"


guest hypervisor config (L1):

Bridge uplink
        Port uplink
            Interface uplink
                type: internal
        Port "eth1"
            trunks: [226, 227]
            Interface "eth1"
        Port "vnet0"
            tag: 226
            Interface "vnet0"

So, eth1 here (L1) is actually vnet6 on hypervisor (L0). If vnet6 (L0) has both
trunk and tag the traffic never reaches eth1 (L1) anymore (and of course also
not vnet0: guest vm (L2)).

What I would expect (but does not seem to happen) is to see traffic with vlan tag "226"
be both passed tagged as wel as untagged for vnet6 (L0).

Does this make sense?

Thanks,

Stefan Kooman

The native-tagged and native-untagged modes use "trunks" and "tag"
simultaneously.  The database schema format is not in any case powerful
enough to allow one to constrain fields so that one or the other but not
both may be set.

No, that's not supported.

Subject: [ovs-discuss] packet modification on egress port
Message-ID: <03135AEA779D444E90975C2703F148DC1396B0F1@IRSMSX107.ger.corp.intel.com>

Hi All,

I'm trying to set up OF  flows on OVS that will modify packets just before egress on certain ports (but not other ports).

As part of a generic vSwitch (not just OVS) performance test suite I'd like to be able to add certain packet modification actions (dec_ttl, push vlan tag, modify src/dst ip etc) to arbitrary existing flow table configurations. i.e the code to add the rules determining the routing packets between ports would be largely independent of the code that inserted the rules modifying packets.

The test suite will support several different arrangements of VMs but always with two physical ports.  It seems simplest to apply any frame-modifications only to packets destined for egress on the physical ports where they return to the traffic generator.  Doing packet modification at ingress would possibly require further configuration changes to VM interfaces or VNFs which make the code to just 'turn on' packet modification much more complicated.

I thought that by using separate tables for routing and packet-modification along with write_actions in order to select an egress port without actually sending the packet until after any possible frame mod had been completed would look like this:

#start from a clean slate
ovs-ofctl del-flows br0

#table0 pre-route (empty in this example) ovs-ofctl  add-flow br0 "table=0,priority=1 actions=goto_table:1"

#table1 routing
#In this example everything coming in on port1 is egressing on port2 and vice-versa but #there could any number of egress ports involved here. I'm writing the egress port into the metadata in #order to share the selected egress port with table#2 add-flow br0 "table=1,priority=1,in_port=1 actions=write_actions(output:2),write_metadata:2,goto_table:2" ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 "table=1,priority=1,in_port=2 actions=write_actions(output:1),write_metadata:1,goto_table:2"

#table2 post-route
#I'd like any code that wants to modify a pkt before egress to only have to #add an entry here #If a test wants to modify everything egressing on port 2 it just adds the #appropriate high priority line to table#2 - it doesn't have to know or care #about the routing set up in table#1 ovs-ofctl  add-flow br0 "table=2,priority=1000,metadata=2 actions=push_vlan:0x8100,exit"
ovs-ofctl  add-flow br0 "table=2,priority=1 actions=exit"    # << I expect this to egress the pkt on the port set up in table#1

My first problem is:
ovs-ofctl  add-flow br0 "table=1,priority=1,in_port=1 actions=write_actions(output:2),write_metadata:2,goto_table:2"
ovs-ofctl: none of the usable flow formats (OXM,OpenFlow11) is among the allowed flow formats (OpenFlow10,NXM)

This sounds like OF version mismatches, but despite much messing about with --flow_format options for ofctl and  ovs-vsctl set bridge br0
protocols=OpenFlow10,OpenFlow11,OpenFlow12,OpenFlow13 I could not get rid of this error.

Another funny is that goto_table & write_metadata both work (or at least are
accepted) separately but not together!

$ ovs-ofctl  add-flow br0 "table=1,priority=1,in_port=2 actions=goto_table:2" 
$ ovs-ofctl  add-flow br0 "table=1,priority=1,in_port=2 actions=write_metadata:1"
$ ovs-ofctl  add-flow br0 "table=1,priority=1,in_port=2 actions=write_metadata:1,goto_table:2" OFPT_ERROR (xid=0x6):
NXBRC_UNENCODABLE_ERROR

I'd appreciate any help.  I feel that what I want to do is possible but it's turning out to be much more difficult than expected. I am also using dpdk enabled ports if that makes a difference.

$ ovs-vsctl show
 9ce3fe3f-568c-44fe-9d8b-94585311ccca
    Bridge "br0"
        Port "dpdk0"
            Interface "dpdk0"
                type: dpdk
        Port "dpdk1"
            Interface "dpdk1"
                type: dpdk
        Port "br0"
            Interface "br0"
                type: internal

Kindest Regards,
Billy O'Mahony

Just checking - you are using OVS with DPDK and not OVDK as per the diagram?

I'm not quite sure I understand your setup, but the first thing I would check
is that you are affinitising your cores so that you are not trying to run a
pmd and other VM processing on the same core. You can use top -H and taskset.

You need to enable later OpenFlow versions in ovs-ofctl, e.g. see the
FAQ:

   All current versions of ovs-ofctl enable only OpenFlow 1.0 by
   default.  Use the -O option to enable support for later versions of
   OpenFlow in ovs-ofctl.  For example:

       ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows br0

This is because OpenFlow 1.0, even with Nicira extensions, doesn't have
"write_actions".

I agree that this error message is difficult to interpret.

This is because OpenFlow 1.0 with Nicira extensions does support
goto_table and write_metadata.  The latter gets transformed into a
"resubmit" Open vSwitch extension however.

> $ ovs-ofctl  add-flow br0 "table=1,priority=1,in_port=2 actions=write_metadata:1,goto_table:2" OFPT_ERROR (xid=0x6):
> NXBRC_UNENCODABLE_ERROR

This is a bug one way or another.  When ovs-ofctl encodes the goto_table
into OF1.0, it transforms it into "resubmit".  When ovs-vswitchd decodes
it, it sees that the ordering is wrong--since OF1.1+ always executes
instructions in a particular order, OVS enforces that order for
instruction-like extension actions, including "resubmit" which it
classes as an "apply_actions" instruction--and refuses to accept it.
Probably, OVS should just transform that special case internally back
into goto_table.  I'll make a note to do that.

(But you should just add -O to enable your preferred version of
OpenFlow.)

I see it is with dpdk as mentioned in the beginning of mail.

I too noticed many other fields with value "?" for vhost-user port, 
where as it is normally
showing packets/bytes count for other port types. I checked with both 
ofctl dump-ports
and appctl dpctl/show -s .

   port  1: rx pkts=2581437, bytes=183201033, drop=0, errs=0, frame=0, 
over=0, crc=0
            tx pkts=45101499, bytes=67075737796, drop=0, errs=0, coll=0
   port  2: rx pkts=45101499, bytes=?, drop=?, errs=?, frame=?, over=?, 
crc=?
            tx pkts=2581370, bytes=?, drop=0, errs=?, coll=?

As per netdev_dpdk_vhost_get_stats(), only rx/tx_packets and tx_drop 
counts are supported
and I was curious to know logic behind it, though I am checking code to 
assist myself.

Could anyone clarify on why only packets count are supported for dpdk ?

Gowri Shankar

Hi Ben,

Thanks so much for the prompt response. 

Looks like I might have been using --flow_format instead of -O.  

At least what I'm trying to do sounds feasible so I'll keep trying.

Groups are implemented.  I guess you need to upgrade.

No real technical reason, just a legacy of the switch over to the DPDK
vhost library and the byte values not being exposed. There should be a
patch to add some of them very shortly.

Yes I did... "We feel we are making progress on that front, and once
support is added, we will follow it up quickly with another release, which
will likely be the next LTS"

I was looking for a ballpark data for the next LTS... Assuming 4 per year,
within the next 3 to 4 months? Would that be more or less right?

thanks

The first sentence in that paragraph you quoted was about needing the feature supported in the upstream kernel.  We don't maintain the upstream kernel, so it's outside of our control.  I hope that it will be accepted soon, but I don't want to hazard a guess on the timeline.  I will make sure to update everyone when a decision is made.

Groups are implemented.  I guess you need to upgrade.

Subject: [ovs-discuss] Slow to load flows
Message-ID: <1434601722.2056.3.camel@oc7500204423.ibm.com>

Hi-

I am chasing a problem with intermittent delays in passing packets
between ports of a switch  (about 1 second delay).  I did some brute
force debugging with printks and saw an occasional 1 second delay in
obtaining a flow from user-space into the kernel.  Most of the flows are
loaded with little delay,  about 1% of the time I see the 1 second
delay.

I have a single instance of an OVS bridge with 2048 ports.  About 200 of
the ports are exchanging packets.  The traffic flow is very simplistic,
a single port only send packets to one other port, for example port 1
only exchanges packets with port 2, port 3 exchanges with port 4...  I
am creating only the minimal flows that I need for my test using
ovs-ofctl add-flow commands.

I tried setting a  -20 nice value for ovs-vswitchd and ovsdb-server with
no change in the results.

Anyone have an idea what the problem could be or how I might
troubleshoot this?

Subject: [ovs-discuss] QoS removal from port and database
Message-ID: <CD7C01071941AC429549C17338DB8A526AC392A7@IRSMSX101.ger.corp.intel.com>

Hi All,

I have been experimenting with Openvswitch and QoS. I have a question regarding how an existing QoS configuration on a port is removed.

I setup QoS on an existing port with the following command

sudo ovs-vsctl -- set Port $IF_NAME qos=@newqos -- \
    --id=@newqos create QoS type=linux-htb other-config:max-rate=4000000 queues=0=@q0 -- \
    --id=@q0 create Queue other-config:min-rate=4000000 other-config:max-rate=4000000

This gives me the _uuid of both the QoS and Queue entry

0b62cfb0-c335-45ca-8910-ca4030ea13af
24ff16d8-926e-4c12-aad8-b7b06c6ec575

When I send traffic I can see that QoS is indeed configured.

I then remove the QoS configuration on the port with the following command

sudo ovs-vsctl clear Port $IF_NAME qos

I can see that QoS is no longer active on the port as the throughput is no longer being limited.

However when I check the database to see if QoS has been removed the QoS table entry is still present along with the queue entry.

sudo ovs-vsctl list qos
_uuid               : 0b62cfb0-c335-45ca-8910-ca4030ea13af
external_ids        : {}
other_config        : {max-rate="4000000"}
queues              : {0=24ff16d8-926e-4c12-aad8-b7b06c6ec575}
type                : linux-htb

To remove these entries I have to complete an additional step as follows for both QoS and queue

sudo ovs-vsctl  --  destroy  qos 0b62cfb0-c335-45ca-8910-ca4030ea13af
sudo ovs-vsctl  --  destroy  queue 24ff16d8-926e-4c12-aad8-b7b06c6ec575

Previously I assumed that clearing QoS from the port with my first command would automatically clear the database QoS entry as well but it would seem that this is not the case. Is this behavior expected?

I have also seen similar behavior if I destroy the QoS record first. Although the record will no longer be in the database it seems that the port is still configured for QoS until I call clear Port $IF_NAME qos.

Appreciate any insight on this.

Thanks
Ian Stokes

Message-ID: <EDCEC56DA1E05E428B0B5FBB4D07139216C91ABD@xmb-rcd-x06.cisco.com>


Hello,

I am trying to build OVS with DPDK support and I have everything prepared from DPDK side, CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_VHOST_USER=y CONFIG_RTE_BUILD_COMBINE_LIBS=y are set and I do see DPDK generated libintel_dpdk.a combined library. When I run:

configure --with-dpdk=$DPDK_BUILD CFLAGS="-g -O2 -Wno-cast-align"

I am getting :

configure: error:  ----- cannot link with dpdk ------

I would greatly appreciate some suggestion how to resolve this linking issue.  I am running RHEL 7.1 with 3.10.0-229.4.2.el7.x86_64. Latest DPDK cloned from the master and latest 2.3.90 OVS also cloned from the master.

Thank you

I'd start by looking at config.log.  It should show the commands that
"configure" used to try to link against DPDK.  Can you figure out why
they did not succeed?

Hi Ben,

As you suggested I check config.log and it appears the error is not dpdk related but fusea related.

I'd start by looking at config.log.  It should show the commands that "configure" used to try to link against DPDK.  Can you figure out why they did not succeed?

This doesn't make any sense, I can't find any references anywhere to
"libfusea".  OVS doesn't try to link against such a library, nor has
Google heard of such a library.  "libfuse", sure, but not "libfusea".

Dunno.

The mystery is solved. In configure.

        LIBS="$DPDK_LIB $extras $save_LIBS $DPDK_EXTRA_LIB"a

By some reason there was 'a' at the end of this line

After I removed 'a' everything started to work. Thank you!!

Subject: [ovs-discuss] how to remove GRE headers using open flow
Message-ID: <BAY172-W124514FDB5DFD7CE6DF642B2A50@phx.gbl>

hi all, i am new to OVS. i have a problem.
i have two servers, called A and B, both of them have installed OVS. and they are connected by GRE tunnel.
result of ovs-vsctl show in A:[root at 00259064a21e ~]# ovs-vsctl showaa44e5ff-a8fe-44bb-aef1-536c6cb6f10b    Bridge OVS-SWITCH        Port gre-fit-cernet            Interface gre-fit-cernet                type: gre                options: {remote_ip="115.25.86.12"}        Port "em1"            Interface "em1"        Port OVS-SWITCH            Interface OVS-SWITCH                type: internal        Port "em2"            Interface "em2"    ovs_version: "2.3.1-git4750c96"
and B:[root at fedora Documents]# ovs-vsctl show32f5a39d-d05f-4979-bc17-4914b6b1f84a    Bridge OVS-SWITCH        Port gre-cernet-fit            Interface gre-cernet-fit                type: gre                options: {remote_ip="202.38.101.24"}        Port "enp3s2"            Interface "enp3s2"        Port OVS-SWITCH            Interface OVS-SWITCH                type: internal    ovs_version: "2.3.1-git4750c96"
there is also a host H connected with A's port "em2" with an Intranet IP
all the traffic destined to H will be delivered through the GRE tunnel and arriving at A.
and i want to using ovs-ofctl add-flow command to add a flow rule to remove the packets GRE headers and redirect the rest message(embeded packet) through port "em2" to H 
but i donot know how to add the flow table rule.
here is some commands i have tried, but failed.
1)ovs-ofctl add-flow OVS-SWITCH idle_timeout=0,in_port=OVS-SWITCH/em1/gre-fit-cernet,dl_type=0x800,nw_proto=0x2F,actions=strip_vlan,output:em22)ovs-ofctl add-flow OVS-SWITCH idle_timeout=0,in_port=OVS-SWITCH/em1/gre-fit-cernet,dl_type=0x800,nw_src=115.25.86.12,tun_dst=10.0.0.2(host H's ip address),actions=output:em2
thanks!

Hello,

I am trying to build OVS with DPDK support and I have everything prepared from DPDK side, CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_VHOST_USER=y CONFIG_RTE_BUILD_COMBINE_LIBS=y are set and I do see DPDK generated libintel_dpdk.a combined library. When I run:

configure --with-dpdk=$DPDK_BUILD CFLAGS="-g -O2 -Wno-cast-align"

I am getting :

configure: error:  ----- cannot link with dpdk ------

I would greatly appreciate some suggestion how to resolve this linking issue.  I am running RHEL 7.1 with 3.10.0-229.4.2.el7.x86_64. Latest DPDK cloned from the master and latest 2.3.90 OVS also cloned from the master.

Thank you

Serguei

Looking through the change log I'm not able to tell when this was 
introduced -- want to make sure that we're at or beyond that point.  Do 
you know which version introduced this, or is there something in the 
source that would be easily spotted if I had a peek?

Thanks again,
Scott

Looks like your configure script is damaged with a typo, so just run
# grep -n 'lfusea' *

and you will find where it is.
I'd say to bootstrap the tree again.

You'll need OVS 2.3 for userspace and either the paired kernel module
or the module from Linux 3.17.

Subject: [ovs-discuss] ovs 2.3.2 and dpdk compiling issue
Message-ID: <EDCEC56DA1E05E428B0B5FBB4D07139216C92E06@xmb-rcd-x06.cisco.com>

Hello,

I tried to make OVS 2.3.2 with the latest dpdk library and compile is failing. I was wondering if it is me doing something wrong or it is in fact an issue. Here are the steps to repro:

1.       Git clone the latest dpdk

2.       Build it with Combine library and vhost_user set to Yes

3.       Run boot.sh

4.       ./configure --with-dpdk=$DPDK_BUILD (Completed sucsesfully)

5.       make CFLAGS='-O3 -march=native'


Below is the resulted messages.  I would greatly appreciate if you could confirm if it is the issue or I do something wrong.

Thank you

Serguei

Hi,

I am trying to load the in_port value to register, like this:

ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 "tcp,in_port=1,actions=load:NXM_OF_IN_PORT[

But it keeps giving me the following error;

ovs-ofctl: NXM_OF_IN_PORT[ ]->NXM_NX_REG0[0..15]: missing `->' following

Message-ID: <D1AA1D1A.3172%diproiettod@vmware.com>

Hi,

OVS 2.3.2 supports DPDK 1.6, as stated in INSTALL.DPDK.
Many APIs have changed in DPDK in a backward incompatible
way.

Also, DPDK support in OVS 2.3.2 is experimental.  It would be
better to use the code from branch-2.4

Hello Daniele,

Thank you for your reply. What is interesting is that ovs 2.3.1.90 compiled perfectly fine with dpdk 2.0 so I assumed since 2.3.2 was announced as 2.3.1 plus bug fixes, it would work fine as well.

Please let me know how I can clone  branch-2.4 and if it still has limitation of supporting only dpdk 1.6??

Thank you

Serguei

Subject: Re: [ovs-discuss] ovs 2.3.2 and dpdk compiling issue

Hi,

OVS 2.3.2 supports DPDK 1.6, as stated in INSTALL.DPDK.
Many APIs have changed in DPDK in a backward incompatible way.

Also, DPDK support in OVS 2.3.2 is experimental.  It would be better to use the code from branch-2.4

I assume you mean "2.3.90" (which was master), not "2.3.1.90"; I don't think such a version ever existed.  We use ".90" to indicate that the code it contains will be part of the next major release.  In this case, 2.3.90 became 2.4.0.  If you look at master now, you'll see it's version is 2.4.90, which will become 2.5 or 3.0 depending on what we decide to call it.  If you look at branch-2.3, you'll see that it contains the next minor version number 2.3.3, since we don't use the .90 convention for minor releases.

> Please let me know how I can clone  branch-2.4 and if it still has limitation of supporting only dpdk 1.6??

I'll leave this one to Daniele.

You are right, my mistake it was 2.3.90. As per your suggestion I cloned master and tried to compile again, it got much further but still failed with this errors:

I assume you mean "2.3.90" (which was master), not "2.3.1.90"; I don't think such a version ever existed.  We use ".90" to indicate that the code it contains will be part of the next major release.  In this case, 2.3.90 became 2.4.0.  If you look at master now, you'll see it's version is 2.4.90, which will become 2.5 or 3.0 depending on what we decide to call it.  If you look at branch-2.3, you'll see that it contains the next minor version number 2.3.3, since we don't use the .90 convention for minor releases.

Ok It is fixed now. It appears if you enable CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_VHOST_USER=y  you must have  CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_VHOST=y as well otherwise it fails at linking stage. Probably is a good idea to add in the documentation.  Now I am up and running with traffic.

Thank you

Message-ID: <01e601d0aad1$ce6ef790$6b4ce6b0$@snoopy.ORG>

 

Greetings,

 

I am currently running

3.16.0-4-amd64

No LSB modules are available.

Distributor ID: Debian

Description:    Debian GNU/Linux 8.1 (jessie)

Release:        8.1

Codename:       jessie

ovs-vsctl (Open vSwitch) 2.3.1

Compiled Jun 15 2015 19:30:36

DB Schema 7.6.2

libvirtd (libvirt) 1.2.9

 

and I am seeing an MTU issue where packets coming in from the physical side
are vanilla 1500Bytes

Once it gets to the virtual NIC I see the following in dmesg:

 

[ 6754.472356] openvswitch: vnet5: dropped over-mtu packet: 1502 > 1500

[ 6754.472363] openvswitch: inter-1tom: dropped over-mtu packet: 1502 > 1500

 

If I set BOTH the vnet5 vnic to mtu 1502 AND the guest OS MTU to 1502 things
will flow

Otherwise mant protocols with full sized packets will see timeout.

 

Wireshark loaded on the client didn't help, as a trace done on the client
itself sees the IP packets coming in (AFTER adjusting MTU to 1502) as 1500.

 

I think OVS must be doing something that added a tag to the packets.

Anyone with the same observation?

Cheers,

Subject: [ovs-discuss] Issue with over-mtu packets on tap interfaces for KVM
	guests
Message-ID: <CACqfFdJbkfM=2-yi-Nz6tED4iz+sBHE1A1X9-iw=nKHbwGX+Xg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am seeing a lot of (almost 50%) over-mtu packets on the tap interfaces
used by KVM guests.

I just don't know if this is an issue with Open vSwitch, the tap driver,
KVM or the guest OS?

Any feedback on how I could further troubleshoot/deal with this issue would
be appreciated.

OS on the hypervisor is Debian 8, latest stable. With Open vSwitch 2.3.0


# dmesg | tail
[48548.208021] openvswitch: tap0: dropped over-mtu packet: 1501 > 1500

[48548.208035] openvswitch: tap0: dropped over-mtu packet: 1501 > 1500
[48548.208094] openvswitch: tap0: dropped over-mtu packet: 1501 > 1500
[48548.243494] openvswitch: tap0: dropped over-mtu packet: 1501 > 1500
[48548.243512] openvswitch: tap0: dropped over-mtu packet: 1501 > 1500
[48548.243532] openvswitch: tap0: dropped over-mtu packet: 1501 > 1500
[48548.243538] openvswitch: tap0: dropped over-mtu packet: 1501 > 1500
[48548.243544] openvswitch: tap0: dropped over-mtu packet: 1501 > 1500
[48548.243550] openvswitch: tap0: dropped over-mtu packet: 1501 > 1500

Note: If I increase the MTU of the tap0 interface to 1501, I start seeing
MTU 1502 packets

Subject: [ovs-discuss] Seek advice for direct r/w to an ovs port

Hi all:

I am a developer who is using ovs in my personal project. Recently I am
trying to do some tcp/ip Nat stuff in a program running in userspace, so I
need to read/write whole L2 packets from ovs directly, the way I am taking
now is attaching a tap device to the ovs bridge, and then open the tap
device for reading and writing, Just like this:

ovs-vsctl add-br br0

ifconfig br0 up

ip tun tap add dev tap0 mode tap

ovs-vsctl add-port br0 tap0

However, I found the performance of the tap device is really bad, my Nat
program can just hold up to 2Gbps bandwidth in one tcp connection(test by
iperf), and the cpu(16 cores) usage are almost full, while the bandwidth
between two veth can be 30Gbps.

My nat program is written in GO, so I did a cpu prof of it, then I found
this:

The result of my program’s cpuprof shows that most of cpu is wasting on the
syscalls to read/write tap device.

So, is there any other better way to read/write directly from/to an ovs
bridge’s port?

By the way, I notice that when adding a port to ovs bridge, there is an
option “type=tap” for setting, but I cannot find the related documents
anywhere, will it be any performance promotion if I set the tap interface
with this option? like this:

ovs-vsctl set interface tap0 type=tap

Thanks for paying attention to this help, waiting for your precious advice.

I don't have comments on the rest of your questions, but the FAQ answers
this one (please read to the end):

### Q: I created a tap device tap0, configured an IP address on it, and
    added it to a bridge, like this:

        tunctl -t tap0
	ifconfig tap0 192.168.0.123
	ovs-vsctl add-br br0
	ovs-vsctl add-port br0 tap0

    I expected that I could then use this IP address to contact other
    hosts on the network, but it doesn't work.  Why not?

A: The short answer is that this is a misuse of a "tap" device.  Use
   an "internal" device implemented by Open vSwitch, which works
   differently and is designed for this use.  To solve this problem
   with an internal device, instead run:

       ovs-vsctl add-br br0
       ovs-vsctl add-port br0 int0 -- set Interface int0 type=internal
       ifconfig int0 192.168.0.123

   Even more simply, you can take advantage of the internal port that
   every bridge has under the name of the bridge:

       ovs-vsctl add-br br0
       ifconfig br0 192.168.0.123

   In more detail, a "tap" device is an interface between the Linux
   (or *BSD) network stack and a user program that opens it as a
   socket.  When the "tap" device transmits a packet, it appears in
   the socket opened by the userspace program.  Conversely, when the
   userspace program writes to the "tap" socket, the kernel TCP/IP
   stack processes the packet as if it had been received by the "tap"
   device.

   Consider the configuration above.  Given this configuration, if you
   "ping" an IP address in the 192.168.0.x subnet, the Linux kernel
   routing stack will transmit an ARP on the tap0 device.  Open
   vSwitch userspace treats "tap" devices just like any other network
   device; that is, it doesn't open them as "tap" sockets.  That means
   that the ARP packet will simply get dropped.

   You might wonder why the Open vSwitch kernel module doesn't
   intercept the ARP packet and bridge it.  After all, Open vSwitch
   intercepts packets on other devices.  The answer is that Open
   vSwitch only intercepts *received* packets, but this is a packet
   being transmitted.  The same thing happens for all other types of
   network devices, except for Open vSwitch "internal" ports.  If you,
   for example, add a physical Ethernet port to an OVS bridge,
   configure an IP address on a physical Ethernet port, and then issue
   a "ping" to an address in that subnet, the same thing happens: an
   ARP gets transmitted on the physical Ethernet port and Open vSwitch
   never sees it.  (You should not do that, as documented at the
   beginning of this section.)

   It can make sense to add a "tap" device to an Open vSwitch bridge,
   if some userspace program (other than Open vSwitch) has opened the
   tap socket.  This is the case, for example, if the "tap" device was
   created by KVM (or QEMU) to simulate a virtual NIC.  In such a
   case, when OVS bridges a packet to the "tap" device, the kernel
   forwards that packet to KVM in userspace, which passes it along to
   the VM, and in the other direction, when the VM sends a packet, KVM
   writes it to the "tap" socket, which causes OVS to receive it and
   bridge it to the other OVS ports.  Please note that in such a case
   no IP address is configured on the "tap" device (there is normally
   an IP address configured in the virtual NIC inside the VM, but this
   is not visible to the host Linux kernel or to Open vSwitch).

   There is one special case in which Open vSwitch does directly read
   and write "tap" sockets.  This is an implementation detail of the
   Open vSwitch userspace switch, which implements its "internal"
   ports as Linux (or *BSD) "tap" sockets.  In such a userspace
   switch, OVS receives packets sent on the "tap" device used to
   implement an "internal" port by reading the associated "tap"
   socket, and bridges them to the rest of the switch.  In the other
   direction, OVS transmits packets bridged to the "internal" port by
   writing them to the "tap" socket, causing them to be processed by
   the kernel TCP/IP stack as if they had been received on the "tap"
   device.  Users should not need to be concerned with this
   implementation detail.

   Open vSwitch has a network device type called "tap".  This is
   intended only for implementing "internal" ports in the OVS
   userspace switch and should not be used otherwise.  In particular,
   users should not configure KVM "tap" devices as type "tap" (use
   type "system", the default, instead).

You need to use "move" instead of "load".

Hi,

Thanks for reply. I missed Ansis's reply "Pravin told me that he will
look into this patch before applying".
Patch which I sent is for 3.18.4 kernel. latest kernel branch has
moved the code to new function.
If needed I can send the patch for latest kernel version.

Harsh Jain

Sorry for late reply. I forgot to reply to your patch.
The patch is enhancement, so send the patch against latest net-next to
netdev and ovs-dev mailing list.

Thanks,

Subject: [ovs-discuss] OVS HW Offload
Message-ID: <CAOv37=CW6UwTp5hHF58V2-sj0kDYduMcCMOcuj08WO5j4k6Kzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I came across the OVS HW offload design proposal at the below link:

http://openvswitch.org/pipermail/dev/2015-March/051937.html

Is there any implementation going on this design currently?
If so, please point me to the ovs repository having these changes.

The "load" that it uses there is an argument to the "learn" action, not
an action of its own.

I was following this link:

The entry in Table 2 uses load.

Hi All, 

Is there any possibility that OVS allows DHCP request (broadcast) originating from the interfaces(mostly virtual interfaces like tap/tunnel) controlled by itself? 
The NetworkManager is running on the system, is there any possibility that NM is trying assign IP to the interfaces controlled by OVS? 

Thanks,

Hi,
I am trying to do simple arithmetic before giving the groupId as part of group action to flow entry like below:
For example: add 10 to groupId; (arithmetic operation)             group:groupId       (group action of flow entry)
But I am not able to find any reference in manual or other documents on how to do simple arithmetic operations to groupId before giving it to flow action like 'group:groupId'. I saw registers used for storing group ids but not able to find the arithmetic operations.
Thanks in advance,Saif

Hey,

I'm pretty new at this. But I was trying to add queues to my openvswitch
using ovs-vsctl. But I was wondering, is there any way that the openflow
controller would be able to add those queues by itself and modify their
min-rates, max-rates as required for weighted processor sharing in queues?

OpenFlow does not support arithmetic.

OpenFlow leaves queue configuration as a problem for configuration
protocols (such as OF-CONFIG and OVSDB).

I thought OVS takes total control on the interfaces it handles.
How to stop this "DHCP request" messages?

Thanks,

Probably best to switch to the ovs-discuss mailing list for this as it
doesn't look like a DPDK issue. I suggest using use the head of master
for OVS with DPDK 2.0.0 and stepping through the INSTALL.DPDK.md then.

Hi



I tested with the below mentioned topology, having a broadcast flow whose actions were set to broadcast group ID. When I tried to ping from host h1 to h2, ARP request packet is sent out to only one port and not to all ports. We have created a group of type "all" with the egress ports set to port3 and port4. The expectation here is that any flow that uses this group has to egress the traffic on both the ports. In the below tcpdump capture you can see that ARP-Request traffic goes out of port4 and not thro' port3.



This seems to be a bug and I request your inputs.

Hi
                We are experiencing a problem with traffic-flow with the below mentioned topology and scenario.

Topology :

H1 ----|      |
     ----| S1 |---H2


We have 2 links(Port1 and Port2) connected from host H1 to switch S1 and 1 link(Port3) between S1 and H2.

Groups :
We have the following 2 groups created where group 8165 uses both the group 58912 and port 3

OFPST_GROUP_DESC reply (OF1.3) (xid=0x2):
group_id=58912,type=select,bucket=weight:0,actions=output:1,output:2
group_id=8165,type=all,bucket=actions=group:58912,output:3

Flows:

root at mininet-89:~# sudo ovs-ofctl -O Openflow13 dump-flows s1
OFPST_FLOW reply (OF1.3) (xid=0x2):
cookie=0x0, duration=7433.711s, table=0, n_packets=1149, n_bytes=48258, arp,dl_src=02:01:02:03:04:08,dl_dst=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff actions=group:8165
cookie=0x0, duration=7457.281s, table=0, n_packets=1062, n_bytes=44604, arp,dl_src=00:00:00:00:00:22,dl_dst=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff actions=group:8165
cookie=0x3000000000000000, duration=8291.778s, table=0, n_packets=560, n_bytes=69440, priority=5,dl_dst=01:80:c2:00:00:02,dl_type=0x8809 actions=CONTROLLER:65535

We have created 2 flows manually to handle ARP request packet that would use the group 8165 as egress ports.


Observation :

*         Now when ARP request is sent from host H1 to H2, we do see that switch S1 is receiving ARP Requests and the ARP flow is hit. However, ARP request is not sent to the port3 as expected. In Group table, when Group ID 58912 is removed from group 8165, we see that the ARP requests are reaching H2 from H1.

*         Also when ARP request is sent from host H2 to H1, it is received in switch S1, but does not egress out


We always see that the traffic is not sent out of the ports described in the flows, when a flow uses a Group ID that in turn uses another group ID in the "actions" qualifier. This appears to be a bug. Can you pl. look into it.


Thanks and Regards
R. Kavitha

hi  all

i want to use ovs-conntrack.
i know ovs is in : https://github.com/justinpettit/ovs/tree/conntrack
i know kernel module should change : https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/3/2/835

my question is :

1.  ovs-conntrack use
should i use those patch ? https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/3/2/835

2. if i must use those kernel patch
 github( kernel+ovs kernel patch ) address is ?

3. ovs-ofctl command
in our project , we use nf_conntrack extension : 

static struct nf_ct_ext_type nf_ct_colo_extend __read_mostly = {
      .len        = sizeof(struct nf_conn_colo),
      .move       = nf_ct_colo_extend_move,
      .destroy    = nf_ct_colo_extend_destroy,
      .align      = __alignof__(struct nf_conn_colo),
      .id		= NF_CT_EXT_COLO,
};

if i want to nf_conntrack extension work.
ovs-ofctl command is ?
please give me some example and advise

I would use the OVS repo.  Those were RFC patches and represent the code on that day.  The OVS repo is more current (there have been a number of bug fixes) and also contains the userspace parts that you need.

As I mentioned, I'd recommend using the OVS repo, which has all the parts you need.  It should be rebased against OVS master in the next couple of days.  I imagine an updated kernel portion will be sent out to netdev in the next few weeks.

If you use the OVS repo, the man pages for ovs-ofctl were updated.  Look for the new "ct" action and "conn_state" match.

I think there is a disconnect between your intent in the question and
my understanding of it. The best way is to not enable DHCP on OVS
interfaces or on external ports added as ports to a OVS bridge. If
your question is to programmatically disable it, you will need to add
OpenFlow flows to disable DHCP requests.

OpenFlow doesn't require support of group chaining.  OVS 2.4 and earlier
don't support group chaining, but OVS 2.5 will.

Your "all" group has one bucket with two output actions.  That's a
mistake, because OpenFlow says that the actions in a bucket are an
"action set", meaning that only one action of each type can be
effective.  The solution is to use two buckets, each with one output
action.

Hello,
I am a newbie to this environment and I am unable to find which release of DPDK works fine with Openvswitch. I hope you could enlighten me with some docs or references with which I could build a working setup - 
RHEL 6.6DPDK - 1.7.1OVS - 2.3.1
Following are some steps I figured out from the web & my experiments - 
Error:

Hello,
I created a no controller 2 host topology in mininet. I added the following flows:
user at user-HP-ProBook-4440s:~$ sudo ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 add-flow s1 ip,nw_src=10.0.0.1,actions=group:1user at user-HP-ProBook-4440s:~$ sudo ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 add-flow s1 ip,nw_src=10.0.0.2,actions=group:2
with the corresponding groups being:
user at user-HP-ProBook-4440s:~$ sudo ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-groups s1OFPST_GROUP_DESC reply (OF1.3) (xid=0x2): group_id=1,type=all,bucket=actions=output:2 group_id=2,type=all,bucket=actions=output:1
I test it on  mininet:

 cookie=0x0, duration=49.691s, table=0, n_packets=6, n_bytes=588, ip,nw_src=10.0.0.2 actions=group:2

Why are the bucket counters not getting updated like the flow counters? Is there something I should do for that? Also thanks :)

Message-ID: <BLUPR03MB26438D2783EDEEE23C6C491B7A00@BLUPR03MB264.namprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Hi All,

I'm a newbie to openvswitch and I followed the below link to install ovs with DPDK on RHEL7 machine.

[root at artha ~]# uname -a
Linux BL4 3.10.0-123.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon May 5 11:16:57 EDT 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/blob/master/INSTALL.DPDK.md

When I ran vswitch daemon, it reports following error [I binded igb_uio to the i350 NIC].

2015-06-22T18:04:38Z|00003|dpdk|ERR|No Ethernet devices found. Try assigning ports to UIO.
2015-06-22T18:04:38Z|00004|dpdk|INFO|Ethernet Device Count: 0

Following PCI bind status.

[root at artha ~]# ./dpdk-1.7.1/tools/dpdk_nic_bind.py --status

Then I created I ovs bridge using below cmd:
./ovs-vsctl --no-wait add-br ovs -- set Bridge ovs datapath_type=netdev
./ovs-vsctl add-port ovs dpdk0 -- set Interface dpdk0 type=dpdk

When I add dpdk port it reports, "could not open network device dpdk0 (Unknown error -19)"

Please let me know

1.  What could be possible reason for not detecting the interface which is binded to igb_uio?

2.  How to add the port which is binded to igb_uio here?

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Varun

Hello,              I'd like to know if you can increment the registers ie: load:0x001122334455->NXM_NX_REG1[0..15]
and then after this can I do something to increment NXM_NX_REG1  ?

Hi



I tested with the below mentioned topology, having a broadcast flow whose actions were set to broadcast group ID. When I tried to ping from host h1 to h2, ARP request packet is sent out to only one port and not to all ports. We have created a group of type "all" with the egress ports set to port3 and port4. The expectation here is that any flow that uses this group has to egress the traffic on both the ports. In the below tcpdump capture you can see that ARP-Request traffic goes out of port4 and not thro' port3.



This seems to be a bug and I request your inputs.

Hi,

OVS 2.3.2 supports DPDK 1.6, as stated in INSTALL.DPDK.
Many APIs have changed in DPDK in a backward incompatible
way.

Also, DPDK support in OVS 2.3.2 is experimental.  It would be
better to use the code from branch-2.4 (with DPDK 2.0)

The commands you're typing seem correct.

Which version of OVS are you using? How are you compiling it?

I hope you realize that bugs at openvswitch.org is a public mailing list.
Nothing on it can be confidential.

Yes.  This is a property of how OpenFlow is defined.

OVS doesn't have a feature for that.

This behavior is documented in ovs-ofctl(8).  Search for "QoS" and
you'll find explanations and examples.

Excuse me, that's ovs-vsctl(8).

Could you define "total control"?

> How to stop this "DHCP request" messages?

It is not Open vSwitch that chooses whether DHCP client will be
running for particular network interface. For example on Ubuntu 15.04,
If I do

ps -Af | grep dhclient
root      1011   773  0 Jun22 ?        00:00:00 /sbin/dhclient -d -q
-sf /usr/lib/NetworkManager/nm-dhcp-helper -pf
/run/sendsigs.omit.d/network-manager.dhclient-wlan0.pid -lf
/var/lib/NetworkManager/dhclient-cfb34368-76b5-4d00-93e0-6499bd8cf2cc-wlan0.lease
-cf /var/lib/NetworkManager/dhclient-wlan0.conf wlan0
root     12214   773  0 11:30 ?        00:00:00 /sbin/dhclient -d -q
-sf /usr/lib/NetworkManager/nm-dhcp-helper -pf
/run/sendsigs.omit.d/network-manager.dhclient-eth0.pid -lf
/var/lib/NetworkManager/dhclient-0e5f5c89-6b38-4564-941f-f7aa54b4deae-eth0.lease
-cf /var/lib/NetworkManager/dhclient-eth0.conf eth0

And then search for parent process (773 in my case):
root       773     1  0 Jun22 ?        00:00:22
/usr/sbin/NetworkManager --no-daemon

It says that it is NetworkManager that started dhclient (and not any
of Open vSwitch processes). So, if you don't want to run DHCP client
on OVS interfaces, then make sure that you are using the right Network
Manager configuration -

Yes, I stopped network manager from running DHCP client on OVS interfaces.

By total control, I meant no other local process can see/write to the OVS controlled interfaces.
I was wrong in my understanding.


Thanks,

I found 2 ovs repo in Kernel.org git repositories
1. https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/pshelar/openvswitch.git/?h=net_next_ovs
2. https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/jesse/openvswitch.git/
which one you will push ?
I git clone net_next_ovs, but not find any kernel patch for ovs-conntrack

I've never heard of this problem before and there were two threads
started on it within 10 minutes, so I'm combining them together on the
assumption that they are somehow related.

It's not really obvious to me how or why OVS would be increasing the
size of the packet by 1 or 2 bytes, especially if the packet is just
flowing through. As I said, I've never heard this reported before. In
the other message, it looks like OVS should be removing a VLAN tag. Is
that true in both cases?

Similarly, in the other thread, it looks the MTUs of the physical
interfaces are 9000, which makes it seems like it is possible that
these packets are actually coming across the wire. What happens if the
MTUs are all the same, as required by Ethernet specs?

Finally, it would be helpful to try this with the Linux bridge instead
of OVS, if possible, since it seems likely that the cause may be
another component.

Thank you Ben for your quick response. Is there any feature # that I could use if for reference for this enhancement work.

Thanks and Regards

OpenFlow doesn't require support of group chaining. OVS 2.4 and earlier don't support group chaining, but OVS 2.5 will.

Hello Alex,

 

It happened again and I got some gdp traces, please see the output in the attachment.

During the gdb session the openvswitch started working again, so I’m not sure if I got the right point.

 

Please have a look and let me know if you need additional information. 

Thanks in advance!

 

Cheers

Chris

Thx for the info, I'll try reproduce it on my local setup using active-backup

bond.  And use it as managment interface,

 

Will update if I run into the same issue~

 

Thanks,

Alex Wang,

Hello Alex,

 

I will do the gdb debug when it happens again. 

 

Here the output, in this case there are 4 VMs running on the host. The physical interfaces eth2 & eth3 are in active-passive mode bonded to bond0. mgmt0 is used for the management of the host system. Anything else is created by OpenStack.

The failure happens independent from the number of VMs running on the host:

Hello,

We are using Openvswitch in our Openstack setup.

ovs-vswitchd --version
ovs-vswitchd (Open vSwitch) 2.3.0
Compiled Oct 28 2014 17:48:05
OpenFlow versions 0x1:0x1

We experience openvswitch failures from time to time. It seems to happen
random, no network traffic spikes for example.
The VM ports and the openvswitch port for the host management just stop
working.  But the openvswitch services (ovsdb-server/ ovs-vswitchd) are
still running

For debug purpose the following commands has been executed:

- "ovs-vsctl show" the interfaces are still listed
The ones below didn't show any result and just hang after the execution:
- ovs-appctl bond/show bond0
- ovs-appctl vlog/list
- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-bond0

 

 

This seems to indicate that the ovs-vswitchd process is dead locked...

I could not find comment in branch-2.3 that relates to dead lock.  It would be

helpful if you can gdb into the running ovs-vswitchd process and provide

the backtraces when there is a failure.

 

Or could I know what your setup looks like (ovs-vsctl show output)?

 

Thanks,

Alex Wang,

 

 

 

A "service openvswitch restart" fix it, the connection from the VMs and the
host are back immediately.

Any help appreciated!

Cheers,
Chris

I don't have a feature number but the following commit, which is on the
OVS "master" branch, implements the feature.

Thank you Ben for your quick response. Is there any feature # that I could use if for reference for this enhancement work.

Thanks and Regards

OpenFlow doesn't require support of group chaining. OVS 2.4 and earlier don't support group chaining, but OVS 2.5 will.

Hi Ben,
If we use group type "indirect" instead of "all", multiple egress ports in output action would still fail, right?

thanks

Your "all" group has one bucket with two output actions. That's a mistake, because OpenFlow says that the actions in a bucket are an "action set", meaning that only one action of each type can be effective. The solution is to use two buckets, each with one output action.

Message-ID: <CAOpSVYp8A9KknkZLTSCGjPGhr7mo7zPVQfGzkhtY-aVuc_UCEQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

'flow_hash_symmetric_l4' in flow.c currently includes L2 information (
MAC addresses and VLAN ID) in the hash. However, in certain cases (
e.g. flow to a VRRP IP address on a router ), the MAC addresses for
the return flow are not symmetrical ( because a virtual MAC is used
for VRRP, whereas a physical interface MAC is used for the return
packet )

Why are the MAC addresses included in the hash for IP flows?

I hope you realize that bugs at openvswitch.org is a public mailing list.
Nothing on it can be confidential.

Yes. This is a property of how OpenFlow is defined.

It's sheer coincidence that that posts are only 10 min apart.  

In my setup all interfaces have MTU defined to be 1500 before I applied the workaround. 

I tried to do tcpdump on the client to see if the frames received are over 1516 and ip pkts over 1500... Nope

Will try a simple linux bridge and see. 

Thanks.

Hi Daniele,

Thanks for your reply :)

I'm using openvswitch-2.3.1 and compiled using below set of commands.

export DPDK_DIR=/root/dpdk-1.7.1
cd /root/dpdk-1.7.1
make install T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
cd /root/openvswitch-2.3.1
export DPDK_BUILD=$DPDK_DIR/x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/
./boot.sh
./configure --with-dpdk=$DPDK_BUILD
make

I would like to create a OVS bridge by adding ens3f0 & ens3f1 ports to that.

[root at artha ~]# /root/dpdk-1.7.1/tools/dpdk_nic_bind.py --status
Network devices using DPDK-compatible driver
============================================

Network devices using kernel driver
===================================

0000:0a:00.1 'I350 Gigabit Network Connection' if=ens3f1 drv=igb unused=

 [root at artha ~]# ifconfig -a|grep flags
ens3f0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
ens3f1: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500

PFA setup.sh script, for all the cmd which I used to run ovs.

1. I added "default_hugepagesz=1GB hugepagesz=1G hugepages=1" to the boot line and 1 GB huge page created
2. When I bind igb_uio driver [to 0000:0a:00.0  & 0000:0a:00.1 ] and then if I run vswitch daemon [--with dpdk], Ideally it should detect binded PCI device. Am I right?

Please let me know if I'm missing something or something is incorrect

Thanks & Regards,
Varun

The commands you're typing seem correct.

Which version of OVS are you using? How are you compiling it?

I thought I was using the terminology as you originally used.  The code you should be using is here:

I find that surprising, because OVS 2.3 supports only DPDK 1.6.

To support DPDK 1.7 in OVS we had to

1) Change a few DPDK calls to reflect the updated APIs

2) Add --whole-archive in the linking process to include the pmd
   drivers.  A failure to do so would result in the exact same
   problem you're experiencing.

Somehow it appears that your local copy of OVS includes (1), but
doesn't include (2).

Where did you get the OVS code? Do you have local changes?

Subject: [ovs-discuss] ovs-conntrack action ordering?
Message-ID: <CAK+XE=njXUSy6QpYzowQP6FrGy1qboaC23jfW7+nvxeH-UOoew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been playing about with ovs-conntrack and noticed an issue that
could be a bug. Either that or my understanding is incorrect and would
appreciate clarification.

When we add a rule with a ct(recirc) action I notice that the call to
Conntrack is always the first action in the kernel rule that is created. In
ofproto-dpif-xlate.c a call to compose_conntrack_action() will append a
nl_msg for this action, then call recirculate which uses
commit_odp_actions() to add messages for previous actions before adding its
own recirc action to kernel rule action list.  However, I have also noticed
that when a push mpls action is added that this commit_odp_actions()
function is also called which can affect the tuples sent to nf_conntrack.

e.g. adding the rule:
ovs-ofctl add-flow br0
"conn_state=-trk,action=set_field:1.2.3.4->nw_dst,ct(recirc)"

will result in a kernel rule with actions of order 'ct, set dst ip, recirc'
and the sk_buff sent to nf_conntrack_in will have the source and
destination IP addresses of the matching packet.


adding the rule:
ovs-ofctl add-flow br0
"conn_state=-trk,action=set_field:1.2.3.4->nw_dst,push_mpls:0x8847,ct(recirc)"

will have actions ordered 'set dst ip, ct, push mpls, recirc' and the
destination IP sent into nf_conntrack will be 1.2.3.4

Can you clarify if this discrepancy is a bug? Also, can you clarify what is
the correct way ovs should support Conntrack in an action list? For
example, in the first rule, is it correct that Conntrack should be applied
on the input packet tuples or should the set field be applied before
Conntrack as it appears before it in the ovs-ofctl rule?

Thanks,
John

Hmm, thanks for looking. I did notice that both of you are running
Debian 8. I guess trying the Linux bridge is still the easiest check
to make. One other thing: can you try running ovs-appctl
dpif/dump-flows <BR> while the problem is occurring and post the

I don't totally understand this part. Does this mean that the packet
grows by 501 bytes in this situation? I guess that this can't be the
case, so you probably mean that the receiving VMs MTU was lowered,
which wouldn't really matter in this case since it isn't generating
the packets and they aren't getting there either. Is that correct?
When lowering the MTU, I was to referring to the physical Ethernet
adapters, which are set to 9000.

Subject: [ovs-discuss] Flow-Mode Userspace GRE Tunneling
Message-ID: <8300925C4469CC4D9B142B85733CCF37737B3A5F@mbx024-e1-nj-2.exch024.domain.local>

I’m trying to get flow-mode tunneling working with native GRE tunneling.  I have a 2 port switch, access and trunk (tunnel) with the 2 ports connected to test gear. The problem is that the trunk-to-access direction is not working. It looks like packets are egressing from b1 on port NORMAL, where they disappear.

When I configure port-mode tunneling, everything works and I notice that b1 does not egress to port NORMAL but ingresses directly to b0 from b1.

Another observation is that when it is working for port mode tunneling, the call to “tnl_port_should_receive” in function “xlate_lookup_ofproto_”
sometimes return “true”. For flow mode tunneling, this function always returns “false”.

Here is my flow mode configuration.
I was wondering if you could spot anything obviously wrong or if this is a known issue.



## Flow-based GRE Tunnel

## Access Side
##
ovs-vsctl add-br b0  -- set bridge b0 datapath_type=netdev
ovs-vsctl add-port b0 gre0 -- set Interface gre0 type=gre options:remote_ip=flow options:key=flow
ovs-vsctl add-port b0 dpdk0 -- set Interface dpdk0 type=dpdk
ovs-vsctl set Interface gre0 ofport_request=1
ovs-vsctl set Interface dpdk0 ofport_request=2
ifconfig b0 10.10.20.40 netmask 255.255.255.0

## Output Bridge:
## Tunnel Side
##
ovs-vsctl add-br b1  -- set bridge b1 datapath_type=netdev
ovs-vsctl add-port b1 dpdk1 -- set Interface dpdk1 type=dpdk
ovs-vsctl set Interface dpdk1 ofport_request=1
ifconfig b1  10.10.10.40 netmask 255.255.255.0

## Set up flows:

## Access
##
# in dpdk0, out gre
ovs-ofctl add-flow b0 "in_port=2 action=set_tunnel:123,set_field:10.10.10.2->tun_dst,output:NORMAL"

# in gre, out dpdk0
ovs-ofctl add-flow b0 "in_port=1,tun_src=10.10.10.2,tun_id=123,action=output:2"

## Tunnel
##
# in linux, out dpdk2
ovs-ofctl add-flow b1 in_port=LOCAL,action=output:1

# in dpdk2, out linux
ovs-ofctl add-flow b1 in_port=1,action=output:NORMAL

Trying to troubleshoot a layer 2 issue with the latest intel i40e (Intel X710 / 40Gbit) 

Tested running kernel 3.10 and 4.1. 

Losing connectivity randomly and the arp table displays incomplete entries. 

I've found enabling vlan splinters helps but performance is only about 1.1Gbit enabled. 

Not really sure how to debug this further, have tried the latest intel website drivers to, issue is still persistent with OVS. 

I have tested vmware round robin vswitch and this issue does not persist.

I think I see the problem, a check from port based tunneling was
carried over to the more general native tunneling case. I just sent
out a patch, can you please try it out?

This check only tests to see if a flow has tunnel IP addresses, which
should be true for all decapsulated packets. I guess you are probably
looking at this on the physical bridge, where the packet hasn't been
decapsulated yet? The "sometimes" for port based tunnels would depend
on whether the packet has been decapsulated yet and the never for flow
based tunnels is because the process fails before decapsulation.

Hmm, thanks. All of this seems pretty normal looking. Here's another
thing to try if you can: I think that you are probably running the
kernel module that is part of the upstream kernel in Debian. Since
this problem appears to be isolated to Debian, maybe somehow there is
an issue in the version of the OVS kernel module that they picked up.
Can you try compiling and installing the module that is packaged with
OVS 2.3? I guess either than will fix the issue (as it has been out a
while and nobody has reported a problem) or the issue is somewhere
else in the stack and it will continue even if you swap out OVS for
the Linux bridge.

This is something of a legacy hash function that we shouldn't change
because it's used to coordinate OVS instances running on different
nodes.  That's why it's one of the few places where we're still using
Jenkins hash instead of the better murmurhash.

I'd have no problem introducing a new L4 symmetric hash function that we
can use in places where it's possible to configure a particular hash
function, but we shouldn't change this one.

Sorry, I should have checked whether 2.3 was compatible with your
kernel. You'll need to use pre-release 2.4 instead, which you can find
in branch-2.4 in git.

For me it definitely appears to be something internal to openvswitch, KVM
or the tap driver as I can do MTU 1500 pings to external addresses from
inside the VM which to my limited understanding indicates the extra bytes
are not present when the traffic leaves the hypervisor node.

I worked around this issue by setting the MTU for my VM interfaces on the
hypervisor to 1503. Reducing the MTU on the interfaces inside the VMs had
no effect, ie. I was still getting MTU 1501 packets even when I set the MTU
as low as 1000.

My setup as detailed in my other post is essentially:
Bridge for external traffic with OVS-bond (MTU 9000) - Patch port - Bridge
for VMs - A port for each VM with a tagged VLAN

Hi Daniel,

One more thing about the following command after creating the bridge br0:

ovs-vsctl add-port br0 dpdk0 -- set Interface dpdk0 type=dpdk. 

If I try to execute the above cmd, it says dpdk0 no such device. And if I give specific interface like ens3f0, even that also does not work.

What exactly I should use in this case?

Regards,
Varun

Hi Daniele,

Thanks for your reply :)

I'm using openvswitch-2.3.1 and compiled using below set of commands.

export DPDK_DIR=/root/dpdk-1.7.1
cd /root/dpdk-1.7.1
make install T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc cd /root/openvswitch-2.3.1 export DPDK_BUILD=$DPDK_DIR/x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/
./boot.sh
./configure --with-dpdk=$DPDK_BUILD
make

I would like to create a OVS bridge by adding ens3f0 & ens3f1 ports to that.

[root at artha ~]# /root/dpdk-1.7.1/tools/dpdk_nic_bind.py --status Network devices using DPDK-compatible driver ============================================
<none>

ens3f0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
ens3f1: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500

PFA setup.sh script, for all the cmd which I used to run ovs.

1. I added "default_hugepagesz=1GB hugepagesz=1G hugepages=1" to the boot line and 1 GB huge page created 2. When I bind igb_uio driver [to 0000:0a:00.0  & 0000:0a:00.1 ] and then if I run vswitch daemon [--with dpdk], Ideally it should detect binded PCI device. Am I right?

Please let me know if I'm missing something or something is incorrect

Thanks & Regards,
Varun

The commands you're typing seem correct.

Which version of OVS are you using? How are you compiling it?

Message-ID: <1642679771.1039.1435167199398.JavaMail.zimbra@beyondhosting.net>

Trying to troubleshoot a layer 2 issue with the latest intel i40e (Intel X710 / 40Gbit) 

Tested running kernel 3.10 and 4.1. 

Losing connectivity randomly and the arp table displays incomplete entries. 

I've found enabling vlan splinters helps but performance is only about 1.1Gbit enabled. 

Not really sure how to debug this further, have tried the latest intel website drivers to, issue is still persistent with OVS.

Hi Jesse,

I just checked to see if there's any vlan related settings in my OVS that might get it to insert a tag and I found nothing.
I have a funny feeling that *might* be Debian 8 related vs OVS 2.3 (I am now using 2.3.2).  An old Wheezy machine using OVS OVS 1.11.1 doesnt have this problem when I compare them side-by-side.

I've never heard of this problem before and there were two threads started on it within 10 minutes, so I'm combining them together on the assumption that they are somehow related.

It's not really obvious to me how or why OVS would be increasing the size of the packet by 1 or 2 bytes, especially if the packet is just flowing through. As I said, I've never heard this reported before. In the other message, it looks like OVS should be removing a VLAN tag. Is that true in both cases?

Similarly, in the other thread, it looks the MTUs of the physical interfaces are 9000, which makes it seems like it is possible that these packets are actually coming across the wire. What happens if the MTUs are all the same, as required by Ethernet specs?

Finally, it would be helpful to try this with the Linux bridge instead of OVS, if possible, since it seems likely that the cause may be another component.

Thanks Jesse,

This is plain vanilla when all MTU left at default.  Dmesg showing

Hmm, thanks for looking. I did notice that both of you are running Debian 8. I guess trying the Linux bridge is still the easiest check to make. One other thing: can you try running ovs-appctl dpif/dump-flows <BR> while the problem is occurring and post the output?

Thanks for the kind advice.

Tried this:

/usr/local/src/openvswitch-2.3.2# ./configure --prefix=/usr --localstatedir=/var --with-linux=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build
And got this:

configure: error: Linux kernel in /lib/modules/3.16.0-4-amd64/build is version 3.16.7, but version newer than 3.14.x is not supported (please refer to the FAQ for advice)

How do I compile and install the kernel modules?
Thanks,

-Johnson

Hmm, thanks. All of this seems pretty normal looking. Here's another thing to try if you can: I think that you are probably running the kernel module that is part of the upstream kernel in Debian. Since this problem appears to be isolated to Debian, maybe somehow there is an issue in the version of the OVS kernel module that they picked up.
Can you try compiling and installing the module that is packaged with OVS 2.3? I guess either than will fix the issue (as it has been out a while and nobody has reported a problem) or the issue is somewhere else in the stack and it will continue even if you swap out OVS for the Linux bridge.

Sorry, I should have checked whether 2.3 was compatible with your kernel. You'll need to use pre-release 2.4 instead, which you can find in branch-2.4 in git.

As following topology, two VMs communicate via VXLAN tunnel.

Now I can change the VMs' MTU from default to smaller to accommodate the

The way I have not find to change mtu of DPDK phy port, is there a

Subject: [ovs-discuss] [dpdk-ovs] dpdk pmd threads use only one numa node
Message-ID: <CAJoD7yQ-Qm3zRwsuUi8i6J=O1XXJq0gnYPJV5nWjq3OKhyG5Mw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

I am trying to build VM to VM scheme using ovs (git branch-2.4) and DPDK
2.0.0.

I start ovs-vswitchd like this.

# ovs-vswitchd --dpdk -cuse_dev_name my-vhost-net -c 0x401 -n 4
--socket-mem 1024,1024 -- unix:$DB_SOCK --pidfile --detach

and for increase pmd threads, I use following command. (This system has 2
numa nodes and each node has 10 cores.)

# ovs-vsctl set Open_vSwitch . other_config:pmd-cpu-mask=401

but pmd threads are created only on numa node 0. pmd threads are not
created on numa node 1.

So. I test bandwidth rate VM to VM.
VM1, VM2 are on numa node 0
VM3, VM4 are on numa node 1

bandwidth between VM1 to VM2 is about 10Gbps.
but bandwidth between VM3 to VM4 is about 6Gbps.

I think that pmd threads are created on numa node 1, bandwidth between VM3
to VM4 is up to 10Gbps.

Why does pmd threads use only numa node 0?
How can I use pmd threads on all numa nodes?

Thanks,
Cha.

Hi John,

Thanks for reporting this. It sounds like a bug. As an OpenFlow user,
It would be surprising for the order of these actions in the action
list to be rearranged like you report. For many fields this doesn't
matter (eg, if you only write IP then write TCP port), however for
conntrack, the order is more important - when you change the IP
address affects how the connection is tracked.  So the flow generation
for the first rule looks wrong from that perspective.

The core problem here is that while processing the actions list, many
of the "set_field" operations are deferred until the end of the
processing, whereas conntrack action is not. I think we need to come
up with some way to ensure that the flow changes are committed before
adding the conntrack action to the datapath actions list. I suspect
much of the code is already there for this, it just needs to be hooked
up correctly.

For the second flow, in some ways I'm inclined to go with the same
approach - Commit the MPLS before committing the conntrack action.
Also, I don't know what you're expecting the connection tracker to do
when it receives MPLS packets. I doubt that the connection tracker
would understand how to track MPLS packets or associate them with
connections. I'm not sure what behaviour you're getting today, but I
would expect all such packets to come back with conn_state=+trk+inv
(ie, invalid). What does it even mean to connection-track MPLS
packets?

dpdk0 is the correct syntax and should work - using ens3f0 is incorrect and
will not work. 

I think you have a version mismatch between OVS and DPDK. I don't necessarily
think that is the root cause of the problem you are seeing but best to eliminate
and work from a more stable point. How about moving to the OVS 2.4 branch and
using DPDK 2.0?

Hi Joe,

Thanks for the response.

Agree with your MPLS points. I was just using the MPLS example as a
hypothetical situation as I noticed it called the action commit function so
it could be used to modify IP address fields before Conntrack that were not
be modified in other ways.

I was more looking clarification that the ordering of the rule actions is
important in ovs-conntrack so that if we do an IP address set field
followed by a CT() then the updated IP field should pass into nf_conntrack
rather than it being the original tuples (as is now).

To me, the former makes more sense here. For example, if the OVS was
implementing some form of NAT along with connection tracking then using the
input tuples and not updated fields means we could not track flows
bidirectionally.

I will take from your response that OVS-Conntrack should consider the
ordering in this way?

I 'think' the fix for this in the code is quite simple. Just move the
action commit call from the compose_recirculate_action__() in
ofproto-dpif-xlate.c to before the netlink message generation in
compose_conntrack_action() in the same file.  That way previous actions
will be pushed before the conntrack action.  The commit code would also
need to be added to compose_recirculation_action() to ensure the actions
are committed if a recirculation action occurs outside of conntrack.

Thanks,
John

Good example. I agree that the ovs conntrack support should consider
the ordering this way. Setting conn_mark/conn_label is also relevant
to this, as they are currently done via commit_odp_actions(). So they
cannot be done before conntrack() action. This was already how we were
thinking about these commands, and perhaps their ordering should also
be enforced by OpenFlow.

Right, the commit call is what I was looking for. I'll roll this
change into the series soon and start testing with it, see what comes
up. Perhaps the datapath flow translation like this would be a good
test case for the kernel module testsuite too.

Thanks,
Joe

Subject: [ovs-discuss] OVN - Pluggable Distributed DB Infrastructure for
	OVSDB
Message-ID: <CAG9LJa505-0uDXHz46Pgy9WKyT1LAG7LjTN5iCSesEA=8HCyKg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

Currently OVN uses centralized ovsdb-server to serve the Northbound and the
Southbound DB to all the local controllers (sitting at each of the compute
nodes).

It is a single point of failure and probably a major bottleneck to the
operation of OVN in scale.
I know there are efforts to make ovsdb-server distributed using Raft, while
i think this is an important effort i believe that open source is about
being open to alternative and choices while reusing other open and reliable
solutions, this is why i want to suggest the following idea:

Design the DB distribution layer in a pluggable manner, doing so, users can
pick alternate distributed DB options that are reliable and have been in
the market for some time which also have performance optimizations. (Of
course that the default plugin will use the ovsdb-server implementation)
I think an important aspect in this regards is that different
environments/setups with different scale needs can have different solutions
that fits them, the ability to choose which back end to use can help in
these scenarios.

If we analyze OVSDB, there are 3 major areas an alternate solution needs to
support:

1) The DB JSON schema itself
     Should be the same between all solutions

2) The OVSDB protocol features
    like: monitor (publish-subscribe) / transactions / garbage collection /
locking
           sync-verify (multi writes/reads for same values)

    It is important to note that any pluggable solution must support all
these features

3) The connection between the client and the server
     This i believe can be pluggable as long as the messages that are
exchanged (the protocol
     features) are still exchanged

Then the only thing that needs to be modified is basically the client
library which can map
the API's to the client requests depending on the picked solution.

Looking forward hearing your opinions.

Thanks

No, it should be fine. I would probably step through 
https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/blob/master/INSTALL.DPDK.md#building-and-installing
and check if your paths are correct or that you've missed any steps.

The patch works. Thanks for that.

One other anomaly I noticed when displaying tunnel ports:

## port-mode tunnel port, looks good.
##
ovs-appctl tnl/ports/show
Listening ports:
gre_sys (2) : eth_type(0x0800),ipv4(proto=47,frag=no)

## flow-mode tunnel port, port type is garbled
##
ovs-appctl tnl/ports/show
Listening ports:
���  (2) : eth_type(0x0800),ipv4(proto=47,frag=no)

I think I see the problem, a check from port based tunneling was carried over to the more general native tunneling case. I just sent out a patch, can you please try it out?

This check only tests to see if a flow has tunnel IP addresses, which should be true for all decapsulated packets. I guess you are probably looking at this on the physical bridge, where the packet hasn't been decapsulated yet? The "sometimes" for port based tunnels would depend on whether the packet has been decapsulated yet and the never for flow based tunnels is because the process fails before decapsulation.

Would you check config.log? It usually explains what went wrong.

I suspect that the problem you're experiencing might be related
to not having libfuse-dev installed on your system.

Anyway, OVS should depend on libfuse only if DPDK has vhost-cuse
support.  We updated the documentation, but we forgot to update
the build system.

I just sent a patch for that:

http://openvswitch.org/pipermail/dev/2015-June/056853.html

Would you mind checking if it solves your problem?

Thanks,

Daniele

Subject: [ovs-discuss] Vxlan encapsulation exceeds the MTU of dpdk port .
Message-ID: <558BAD5C.9000402@dtdream.com>

As following topology, two VMs communicate via Vxlan tunnel.
TCP pkts may be droped for exceeding the mtu of host DPDK port in br2.
Now I can change the VMs' mtu from default to smaller to accommodate the 
traffics, it works well.

The way I have not find to change mtu of DPDK phy port, is there a 
blueprint for supporting this by ovs, like "ovs-appctl 
netdev-dpdk/set-xxx" or another way?

dpdk0 is the correct syntax and should work - using ens3f0 is incorrect and will not work. 

I think you have a version mismatch between OVS and DPDK. I don't necessarily think that is the root cause of the problem you are seeing but best to eliminate and work from a more stable point. How about moving to the OVS 2.4 branch and using DPDK 2.0?

Subject: [ovs-discuss] Did anybody successfully compiled branch 2.4 with

Message-ID: <BLUPR03MB264A73F6989CB50E980CDA5B7AE0@BLUPR03MB264.namprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Hi Team,

When I tried to configure with branch2.4 [and in master branch also] with DPDK, getting following error. I had updated the following in config/common_linuxapp file in dpdk-2.0 dir.

     `CONFIG_RTE_BUILD_COMBINE_LIBS=y`
     `CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_VHOST=y`

Following error is coming:

Hi,
I got this issue also and after check the config.log, I found that dpdk
build directory was not set correctly.
The correct config: ./configure --with-dpdk=$RTE_SDK/$RTE_TARGET
Where RTE_SDK is your dpdk source and RTE_TARGET is your build target.
Of course, you need to build dpdk first.

OK, thanks. I guess it seems somewhat unlikely to be related to OVS at
this point, although I don't have a good theory as to what would cause
this. Let us know if you find anything more.

Hmm, I'm guess I'm not sure how this would happen and I can't
reproduce it (and I really don't understand why it would be different
between flow-based and port-based tunnels since there shouldn't be any
difference at this level). Does this happen consistently for you? What
about different types of tunnels or any other clues you can spot?

When I see stuff like this, I try "valgrind".

Subject: [ovs-discuss] OVS bug on Ubuntu 14.04
Message-ID: <558CA48B.4050605@uniroma2.it>

Hi,

we are not able to push MPLS labels (even a single one) in Ubuntu 
14.04.1 LTS, with kernel 3.13.0-34 using open vswitch 2.390 (master branch)

previously it was working, for example we have no problem with kernel 
3.8.0-35 (in which we were also able to push multiple MPLS label)

as a simple test scenario, we use a mininet topology with 2 hosts and 
one ovs-kernel switch

H1 ----> SW -----> H2

SW is supposed to take ingress traffic from H1, push one MPLS label and 
forward to H2

the rules are installed in OVS and visible with ofctl, but when a packet 
enters the switch from H1, the packet is not forwarded (while the 
statistics are increased) and the following error is logged in 
ovs-vswitchd log:

2015-06-16T11:38:08.448Z|00179|dpif(handler9)|WARN|system at ovs-system:

Hi,

(sorry for dropping the mailing list, I had troubles with a new mail client)


I think that the problem is in the translation of queue names between OF, ovs and linux. 


I explain briefly:


I have 3 iperf client, an ovs switch and an iperf server (linked to switch's eth4) 





h1---link 10M---|-s1:eth1---queue1 or 123---\


h2---link 10M---|-s1:eth2---queue2 or 234---|-qdisc---s1:eth4-|---link 10M---h4


h3---link 10M---|-s1:eth3---queue3 or 345---/





I direct the traffic of each client on a separate queue to see how 
bandwidth sharing reflects scheduler's setting (observed from h4)





---------HTB-------------


In both htb cases, the controller install rules that direct flows to queues 123, 234, 345.


---case1, ovs commands, working---


With ovs commands I create queue 123, 234, 345 (that in exa correspond to 7b, ea, 159).


When I check with tc commands, I notice that Linux kernel automatically 
creates an htb qdisc 1:, to which is attached class 1:ffe,to which are 
attached classes 1:7c, 1:eb, 1:15a (notice that it increments the number
 of 1). Everything works.


---case2, tc commands, working---


I can also execute directly tc commands (creating classes ffe,7c,eb,15a)
 and obtain the same htb scheduler, and everything works.


 


(bandwidth is divided as expected, wheter I configure with ovs commands or tc commands)





---------PRIO-------------------------


When I use the command "tc qdisc add dev s1-eth4 root handle 1: prio"


linux kernel creates the qdisc prio 1:, to which are attached classes 1:1, 1:2, 1:3.


Using the same logic of htb (linux increments queue id of 1) I thought 
that the openflow rules should use queues 0,1,2. But every flows get 
simultaneously the whole link capacity.


(I tried also with 1,2,3)





I don't know how to catch the queues' name used by Openflow, since if 
classes are created with tc commands (in both cases, htb and prio) 
"ovs-vsctl list qos" and "ovs-vsctl list queue" gives no answer.





Thank you very much

Hi ,

Could you please tell me what is the difference betwwen ovs-dpctl and
ovs-appctl.
Also let me know what is the difference between ovs and linux bridge ?

Hi Daniele,

After applying your patch, I'm able to build.

Thanks.

Would you check config.log? It usually explains what went wrong.

I suspect that the problem you're experiencing might be related to not having libfuse-dev installed on your system.

Anyway, OVS should depend on libfuse only if DPDK has vhost-cuse support.  We updated the documentation, but we forgot to update the build system.

I just sent a patch for that:

http://openvswitch.org/pipermail/dev/2015-June/056853.html

Would you mind checking if it solves your problem?

Thanks,

Daniele

ovs-dpctl talks to the (often kernel) datapath.  ovs-appctl talks to the various userspace daemons.  I'd recommend looking at the man pages, which should describe them.

OVS provides quite a few more features and remote controllability.

You might find this presentation from a couple of years ago applicable:

There is some information that is a bit more up to date wrt OVS with DPDK if you
look through this thread http://openvswitch.org/pipermail/dev/2015-May/055509.html

Thanks, Guys...
In the Intel paper, if I am not mistaken, the performance is benchmarked with 2 flows.  Wonder what the performance would be like with 100s or 1000s of flows.  Seems more realistic in an SP environment

Tunnel port display works fine on 2.4.90 build. I was running 2.3.90.
Thanks for your help.

Hmm, I'm guess I'm not sure how this would happen and I can't reproduce it (and I really don't understand why it would be different between flow-based and port-based tunnels since there shouldn't be any difference at this level). Does this happen consistently for you? What about different types of tunnels or any other clues you can spot?

Hey Chris,

Sorry for this very delayed reply,

Just checked the core file, very useful,

seems like there is a long running thread holding the
'pthread_rwlock_rdlock'
(possible thread 6?) and starving other threads (including main 'ovs-
vswitchd' thread, which may explain why your ovs-appctl cmd hang)...  To
further investigate, we need the debug info pkg installed, like warned in
the
gdb trace:
"""
Missing separate debuginfos, use: debuginfo-install
openvswitch-2.3.0-1.x86_64
"""

I tried to checkout ovs v2.3.0, compile on my local machine, gdb into it
and run 'info symbol <address in the gdb backtrace>'...  it points me to
totally unrelated function...  so we need to have the debug info pkg from
the
same build...

So, is the ovs pkg you used publicly downloadable?  if so, could you point
me to that, so that I can investigate myself?  if not, could you try
translate
this trace for me? using `info symbol <address>`
"""

Also, could you grep the /var/log/openvswitch/ovs-vswitchd.log* for the
following string:
"""
Unreasonably long
"""
And post the output, if a thread holding the rwlock for very long time,
there will be such log in ovs-vswitchd.log

Thanks,
Alex Wang,

Thanks for the confirmation. I wonder what Debian 8 is doing to screw
things up?

Subject: [ovs-discuss] Multicast over GRE Tunnels
Message-ID: <CAAcraLrBaw_ssKA9iLU7+d8JBYF39ADY9QVR77y8onKFcK=PrQ@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to use OVS/GRE to tunnel multicast between nodes.  I've set up
a test environment, and am unable to get multicast working between GRE
connected nodes(UDP and TCP work fine).

I also found a 5 year old thread suggesting that multicast over GRE isn't
implemented:

http://openvswitch.org/pipermail/discuss/2010-September/004454.html

> This configuration would normally work.  However, multicast isn't
> currently implemented in the Open vSwitch GRE stack.  It's planned and

Should multicast over a GRE tunnel work?


What I've tried(Ubuntu 14.04 w/OVS v2.3.1):

$> ovs-vsctl add-br br1
$> ovs-vsctl set bridge br1 stp_enable=true
$> ip addr add 10.1.2.11/24 dev br1
$> ovs-vsctl add-port br1 gre1 -- set interface gre1 type=gre
options:remote_ip=<remote ip>

When both nodes are configured, I can ping and use iperf for TCP and
UDP test, but attempting a multicast test fails.

Not OVS for sure!! 

I tried a control experiment:  Debian  7.8, OVS 2.3.3

# cat /etc/debian_version 
7.8
root at labeled3sb1:/home/data/pcap/20150626# ovs-vsctl --version
ovs-vsctl (Open vSwitch) 2.3.3
Compiled Jun 26 2015 16:52:46
DB Schema 7.6.2
root at labeled3sb1:/home/data/pcap/20150626# uname -r
3.2.0-4-amd64
root at labeled3sb1:/home/data/pcap/20150626#

ifconfig | grep MTU shows all 1500
No errors in dmesg at all.

The VM behind the OVS is happy as a clam, no timeouts no need for MTU adjustments.

Sorry for the trouble and thanks for all the help Jesse.

Emil I think it may be prudent to reinstall on a 7.8 and not let apt-get upgrade or update get in the way and see.

Cheers,

-Johnson

OK, thanks. I guess it seems somewhat unlikely to be related to OVS at this point, although I don't have a good theory as to what would cause this. Let us know if you find anything more.

I use this:
ovs-ofctl add-flow ovsbr0   "in_port=1,conn_state=+trk+new,tcp,action=ct(commit),1"
ovs-ofctl add-flow ovsbr0   "in_port=2,conn_state=+trk+new,tcp,action=ct(commit),1"
ovs-ofctl add-flow ovsbr0   "in_port=3,conn_state=+trk+new,tcp,action=ct(commit),1"

and ssh can work now.
thanks.

but i have another questions:

1. why tcp can work
i think tcp also use nf_conntrack.
so i think,  without you patch , tcp can not work.

but the result is :
without you patch, ssh(tcp) can work.
but  nf_conntrack extension can not work.
why ?

2. scp can not work
I use nf_conntrack extension .
I use you patch  && ovs-ofctl  command
ovs-ofctl add-flow ovsbr0   "in_port=1,conn_state=+trk+new,tcp,action=ct(commit),1"
ovs-ofctl add-flow ovsbr0   "in_port=2,conn_state=+trk+new,tcp,action=ct(commit),1"
ovs-ofctl add-flow ovsbr0   "in_port=3,conn_state=+trk+new,tcp,action=ct(commit),1"

I find ssh can work
scp can not work.
why?

Message-ID: <7E446A6128134441B5FE3C3D368FE101351235EB@SJEXCHMB10.corp.ad.broadcom.com>

Hi,
I am using ovs-ofctl to test addition/modification/deletion of OF 1.3 flows. I was using the following command to do the actions=mod_nw_tos for OF 1.0,
ovs-ofctl add-flow tcp:10.130.177.160 dl_vlan=128,in_port=12,table=60,priority=100,actions=mod_nw_tos:4,output:24

Now I am using ovs-ofctl -O openflow13 add-flow tcp:10.130.177.160 dl_vlan=128,in_port=12,table=60,priority=100,actions=mod_nw_tos:4,output:24. But I get the following error:
"ovs-ofctl: none of the usable flow formats (OpenFlow10+table_id,NXM+table_id) is among the allowed flow formats (OXM-OpenFlow13)".
How do I achieve the same actions=mod_nw_tos for OF 1.3 using ovs-ofctl?
Regards,
Abhijit

Hi everybody,

I've successfully tested the GRE tunneling between two docker containers in
different hosts which is explained in this

but when I tried to change the connection to VXlan it does not work. I've

connection exists?

I will be grateful for any help you can provide.

Nothing was ever implemented on this front, so it hasn't changed. It
should be possible to run multicast traffic over a unicast tunnel
(since the tunnel itself doesn't care about IP layer) but there's no
support for the tunnels themselves being multicast.

I don't understand these flows.  You can't match on "conn_state" until after your call to ct().  This is documented in the ovs-ofctl man page:

       conn_state=[+flag...][-flag...]
              Bitwise  match  on  connection  state flags.  The flags are only
              available after a call to the ct action with the  "recirc"  flag
              set.

Further, you're sending all of your packets to port 1, which I can't imagine is what you want.

One of the commit messages provides some example flows:

Subject: [ovs-discuss] QoS/traffic-limit on internal ports
Message-ID: <55920598.8070609@gmail.com>

Hi,

I am currently trying to put traffic control on our OpenStack cloud and 
my questions in one sentence would be: *is it possible at all to 
rate-limit particular port with type internal?*

The whole story is as following:
We are running OpenStack Neutron network over OpenVSwitch. Datapath can 
be found here:

https://pinrojas.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/neutron-openstack-openvswitch-router-dnsmasq-gre-kionetworks-plug-in-tap-devices-instances-nova-compute-software-defined-networks-sdn-cloud-layer-1.jpg

Hence, to limit upload/download bandwidth of a particular sub-network, 
the most intuitive approach is to put QoS rules on L3 router agents, 
namely port qr-XXXXXX-XX and qg-XXXXX-XX in Neutron nodes. Both of them 
are *internal type* in OVS-system and I have tried following commands:

1. # ovs-vsctl set interface qr-XXXXXX-XX ingress_policing_rate=2000000
    # ovs-vsctl set interface qr-XXXXXX-XX ingress_policing_rate=2000

2. # ovs-vsctl -- set Port qr-XXXXXX-XX qos=@newqos \
      -- --id=@newqos create QoS type=linux-htb 
other-config:max-rate=2000000 queues=0=@q0 \
      -- --id=@q0 create Queue other-config:min-rate=2000000

Although neither of them seem to be effective when I try iperf within in 
VMs.

Meanwhile, I do achieve rate limit when apply exactly same commands on 
qvoXXXXXX-XX, which is connected to each VM. I've noticed that they are 
normal types.

Therefore, I suspect that rate limit does not support internal port, 
which connects two network namespaces in linux.

Thanks for your valuable time and I truly appreciate your help!

Best Regards,
/J

Subject: [ovs-discuss] surprising effects with exit v's drop
Message-ID: <03135AEA779D444E90975C2703F148DC15A300CF@IRSMSX107.ger.corp.intel.com>

Hi All,

I am getting very surprising (to me at least) effects with the following
flows installed.

I am seeing packets forwarded when I expect them to be dropped and dropped 
when I expect them to be forwarded.

Here is my flow table:

[14:22 ]$ ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows br0
OFPST_FLOW reply (OF1.3) (xid=0x2):
 cookie=0x0, duration=2.860s, table=0, n_packets=0, n_bytes=0, priority=1 actions=goto_table:1
 cookie=0x0, duration=2.845s, table=1, n_packets=0, n_bytes=0, priority=1,in_port=1 actions=write_actions(output:2),write_metadata:0x2,goto_table:2
 cookie=0x0, duration=2.834s, table=1, n_packets=0, n_bytes=0, priority=1,in_port=2 actions=write_actions(output:1),write_metadata:0x1,goto_table:2
 cookie=0x0, duration=2.815s, table=2, n_packets=0, n_bytes=0, priority=1 actions=exit

For a packet ingressing on port1 I'm expecting it to be egressed on port2.
This does not happen however (using a hardware traffic generator) and the 
packet is dropped. ofproto/trace seems to expect this to happen as it says 
"Datapath actions: drop" at the end of its output:

[14:22 ]$ ovs-appctl  -t /usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/ovs-vswitchd.61474.ctl ofproto/trace br0  in_port=1

                Rule: table=2 cookie=0 priority=1

Megaflow: recirc_id=0,in_port=1,dl_type=0x0000
Datapath actions: drop      <<<< SURPRISE!

If I then replace the action in table 2 to 'exit', packets from port1 are indeed
egressed on port2 (again verified by hardware packet generator) and apparently
as predicted by ofproto/trace.

This is all pretty surprising to me though obviously there could be some
subtleties I am missing. I'd appreciate and thoughts or tips from the
community.

Finally, I am using dpdk enabled NICs.

There are two br2 bridge on Host2. It is intentional ?

Btw, I am trying on same page but could not simplify the vm-vxlan-dpdk 
working within "single" bridge case,
may be that I am yet to find right flow rules to handle vhost-user, 
vxlan and dpdk ports.
I hope you are using patch port between two bridges. Would you really 
need it ?

I was able to get multicast traffic over the tunnel after adding a routing
rule for the multicast IP address.  Once I figured that out, I was able to
finish my proof-of-concept successfully.

I look forward to using Open vSwitch in my project.

Thanks to Daniele, I have openvswitch compiled with dpdk. The way I installed is posted sundar-ramki/ovs-dpdk.

I have the following questions - 
1. How do I figure out if my VM is really using Openvswitch with DPDK?
2. Are there any counters for packets entering and leaving the switch and/or dpdk?
3. Also, I am unable to use the ofctl commands. Following is what I get - 
[root at test1 ~]# ovs-ofctl show br23ovs-ofctl: br23 is not a bridge or a socket[root at test1 ~]# ovs-vsctl showd8cfc890-a4fc-4398-869c-59c5412a3e79    Bridge "br23"        Port "eth3"            Interface "eth3"        Port "br23"            Interface "br23"                type: internal        Port "eth2"            Interface "eth2"
Any input will be appreciated.
Thank youSRK

 Hi,

OVS 2.3.2 supports DPDK 1.6, as stated in INSTALL.DPDK.
Many APIs have changed in DPDK in a backward incompatible
way.

Also, DPDK support in OVS 2.3.2 is experimental.  It would be
better to use the code from branch-2.4 (with DPDK 2.0)

Subject: [ovs-discuss] Packet drop on OVS-DPDK bridges
Message-ID: <BL2PR03MB26034F17E780ECFAAEA91F3B7A90@BL2PR03MB260.namprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Hi Team,

I created OVS bridges [on RHEL 7]using the attached Init.sh script [Using ovs-branch 2.4 and DPDK-2.0. Not using 1GB huge pages].

Then I created a KVM instance  and used mactap devices [created by ovs bridge] in that VM instance. I had installed my application on new VM instance and I was able to do the things[calls] successfully. But when I started pumping load, observed good number of call failures.

Then I checked the stats on the OVS bridges and found good number drop count.

[root at artha utilities]# ./ovs-vsctl get Interface pktovs statistics
{collisions=0, rx_bytes=3020971673, rx_crc_err=0, rx_dropped=59038515, rx_errors=0, rx_frame_err=0, rx_over_err=0, rx_packets=13956397, tx_bytes=27949373215, tx_dropped=340854, tx_errors=0, tx_packets=130762243}

Please clarify:
1. What this drop count implies? If it is a problem, then how to overcome this problem?[ by increasing any ring or mbuf sizes??]
2. Do we need to change any buffer ring/size based on traffic on OVS bridges?

Regards,
Varun

Hi,

I want to generate forwarding rules for ovs, and need to get the port id

show, ovs-dpctl show, but they don't show the port id. Could anyone tell me
the commands to implement this task?

Assume you are talking about OpenFlow flows, then please use 'ovs-ofctl
show <bridge-name>'

It's in quite a few places.  The way people usually get it is from the "ofport" column of the Interface table in the database.  You can see it by running "ovs-vsctl list interface".  You can also run "ovs-appctl dpif/show" which will show you both the OpenFlow port number as well as the datapath one.  Another option is with "ovs-ofctl dump-ports br-int".

Hi, Alex,

Thanks for response. I tried that command before, no port number is shown.

Hi, Justin,

Thanks for providing these commands, and "ovs-appctl dpif/show" works
perfect for me. However, I cannot find that command on
http://openvswitch.org/support/dist-docs/ovs-appctl.8.txt or
http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man8/ovs-appctl.8.html. Thus,
how do you know the command? any manual?

Thanks,
Xuemei

As mentioned in the ovs-appctl man page, you have to look at the man page for the daemon:

       Open  vSwitch  daemons  accept  certain  commands at runtime to control
       their behavior and query their settings.  Every daemon accepts a common
       set  of  commands documented under COMMON COMMANDS below.  Some daemons
       support  additional  commands  documented  in   their   own   manpages.
       ovs-vswitchd in particular accepts a number of additional commands doc‐
       umented in ovs-vswitchd(8).

Here's the relevant section from the ovs-vswitchd man page:

       dpif/show
              Prints  a  summary of configured datapaths, including statistics
              and a list of connected ports.  The  port  information  includes
              the  OpenFlow  port  number, datapath port number, and the type.
              (The local port is identified as OpenFlow port 65534.)

Subject: [ovs-discuss] flow table priority
Message-ID: <CAFzAnhgAXzgUQFk=0s1HLQRbkBV0sG7Rt7XQCEYymqUYN8HBAw@mail.gmail.com>

hi all, in ovs, the process to have multiple flow entries for single match
can be differentiate by the priority field. Flow entries with higher number
of priority will be match first.
If there is a way or even supported in OVS that multiple flow table has
priority also like the flow entries.
 For example, first action for specific flow entries is in flow table 0
(match is purposedly configured to not match the packet sent via packet-in
before) and second action (match packet sent via packet-in before) is in
flow table 1 (pre-installed).Then it will force packet-in to sent in again
to controller. This second time, i wanted to redirect the packet to the
preinstalled match and action in flow table 1.
Appreciate if anyone can help shed the light for me. thanks
